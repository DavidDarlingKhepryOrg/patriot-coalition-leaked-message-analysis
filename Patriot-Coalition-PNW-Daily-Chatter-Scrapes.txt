Evening everyone-

Things are getting back to normal üôè

With that being said - here is our board of leaders- they make the decisions together as to if this group gets a call out and will post in the Go Team group... they are the only ones to post in there- once they post- questions and details can be asked...

As far as intel goes- we need a new group of people to step forward and help validate possible issues and report their findings to the board.. please do NOT post possible issues in here- please direct message one of the following

Trent
Dan
Him Who (Chris Tough)
John H
Joseph
Pat
Or Myself

If I have forgotten anyone I will place in another message ...

Once you have sent something to one of them- they will follow up on it and have intel working on it as well.. we will not be getting called out for ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù. People have the 1A and as long as they are peaceful our presence is not needed there- no need to take time away from our families or work.

We need people to be active - we can‚Äôt stop Antifa destroying our state if we refuse to stand up...

We also need you to please reach out to your friends and family and invite them to join the FB group page. From there they will get vetted and added.
As for meetings- we will discuss that further down the line and hope to make them in different places so everyone has a chance to get to one with driving hours each time.

We are starting fresh - regrouping - and going back to the way it was intended for- an action group.

If you chose not to be in this group please let us know and we will remove you from the group so that your phone doesn‚Äôt keep getting blown up

Thank you everyone who has remained. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

We were leaving and they actually shot inside the garage up to the 2nd level. But Antifa will also send the fake female reporters to ask patriots about their guns, and they have blank or live rds for those types and will claim shots, and take pictures of the casings saying patriots shot at them.

I'm asking a question and don't mean any disrespect. Are there more than a handful of Portland residents that are willing to do what's necessary to take their city back from these terrorists?
Avatar
Dan-Medford
I think there are. Trent has been talking to a group up there. Hed know more than I

@John Hufford Not really, we get more FU at our events. Most of Portland is scared, or don't want to get targeted by BLM if they don't support their movement. Also, most down town residents are very successful people who can afford the real estate, and really just don't want to be bothered and don't care.
Avatar
John Hufford
If they don't care enough to do anything about it, why should we?
Avatar
Dan-Medford
@John Hufford in my opinion, if nothing is done then the enemy has a stronghold. Look at the CHOP zone. Since it was allowed to happen and accepted, everyone who wants to "make themselves heard" (besides patriots) now thinks that's ok. If we give up on Portland, it's just a stronghold that will just keep getting worse and worse.
But that's just my personal thoughts
Avatar
John Hufford
I respect your opinion. But if residents don't care enough to defend their own neighborhoods, why should we risk our lives and livelihoods? Worse yet, they turn on us helping them?
Avatar
Dan-Medford
It's my country, my state. As much as I hate portland, it's still part of the USA and i will not stand for a communist/terrorist regime terrorizing it. I should have been up there sooner.
I feel like absolute dog shit for not being up there today. I let fellow patriots down, but thank god no one was seriously hurt.
Not saying that I can change it, or that I'm billy badass, but that I'm willing to try to help.

If they are ignored, then more rebellious thugs want to join up, seeing it as glorifying. They grow more, then they will continue growing and spreading outside Portland.

I agree with you Dan, this country is under siege and there is an enemy encampment that is growing right here in our state. Im not looking for a fight but I pledged allegiance to our Flag and an oath to defend this country against exactly what is happening in Portland. I personally couldn't give a care about the city but if we don't take it back where will they hit next, and after that. Strategically our best move would be to meet them side by side along with our brothers and sisters in blue with hundreds not ten or twenty and drive them out. Stop their nightly occupation of Portland and send a strong message. My two cents....

If we do this. It can't be half-assed. We need to be more violent and aggressive than what we think is necessary. We cannot have a defensive mindset. We must take the attack to them.
Avatar
Chris Tough
Portland should be our main objective, personally I believe it should be our main focus and only objective at this time. Portland has become a safe haven for these scum. I think we should change that. We need numbers. People willing to fight, if We the people do not stand up we will lose ground so fast we will pay heavily trying to regain it. If we end the Portland problem we can step on the little flames that pop up afterwards. I‚Äôm in on taking Portland.
We need numbers. At minimum a 100 patriots willing to fight

John Hufford
I've heard there are organizations in other states who are like minded. If we could organize and coordinate a massive, nationwide offensive that takes place on the same day...

Steve
Lets see what kind of coalition we can put together. I'd like to see one to three hundred. I have friends ready to go.
Avatar
Chris Tough
We need 100 at minimum. Those 100 would have to be willing to fight at all costs. There will be at least 300 if not more of them. We need a large number of patriots. I‚Äôm working on gathering numbers on my end.

One thing everyone needs to realize and accept as well is that if something goes wrong, or even if something doesnt go wrong, the media is gunna spin this as we're the bad guys. I've accepted that. I'm sure most of you have as well. But anyone else we bring in has to understand that as well

There is a group being formed to go to Portland Saturday night- after the daytime rally‚Äôs... to finally take back the Portland neighborhoods!

If you‚Äôre interested in joining (there are multiple different groups coming together for this)- please go to the FB group Patriot Coalition of Oregon‚Äù. Make sure it‚Äôs the actual group that you have to request to join and not the front page that you just ‚Äúlike‚Äù...

Som Luna is planning a march this Saturday as well- shits going to be interesting- I was thinking about making small fliers to give to other patriots during the daytime Sunday asking them to stay and help- what do you think? We should also tell people to wear some sort of colored arm band so we know who each other is when shit gets crazy? Or do you have any other ideas on that?

Flyers leave info for anyone to get their hands on.
Some kind of identification is a good idea, as well as a verbal call and counter call (like in band of brothers, when they'd call "flash" and reply with "thunder"

What was the rule with long rifles in Portland
Avatar
Mark Melchi
@Trent -Medford. We carried in Portland with long rifles at all the events. If the plan is like it sounds, The laws don't really matter. ANTIFA always has loaded fire arms/rifles
The actual Laws are pistol, can be loaded with a CHL, or open carried with no magazine for people without a CHL

Want to make sure people dobt underestimate antifa. They have been battling the police and feds for 80 days yes they have had there asses kicked alot but they are also battle tested. Yes i know they all are soy boys but even Soy boys can be dangerous.
Also we need folks to carry a small spray or squeeze bottle of a mix of 50% water 50% reg milk of magnesia (not mint) to clear your eyes if you get sprayed. Also saline or eye drops and baby wipes. I have been sprayed alot it will not cure it 100% but it will get ypu back in the game or get you home.

My Group 1776 2.0. Has been fighting Antifa in Seattle, Portland, for months. They are all hit an run tactics from a few behind the main rows of people. When things get going. The Portland Ganges who also hide in Antifa will shoot you...Like they have done with a few of our guys. This won't be a simple fist fight. People will get shot, stabbed and beat. We have fought with guys in Portland who are like giant Russians so, they're not all soy boys. We must be ready to defend with lethal response. If we don't get to enough of them they will just comeback when we leave, just like the Taliban did in Afghanistan. We need to make it dramatic enough for them not to want to return. Suggest wearing mask and nothing to identify you on Camera...to prevent any future prosecution.

Antifa will dress up a guy in stereotypical right wing clothes have him stand in our group and throw Nazi salutes while his friends take pictures or have a swastica on him for them to photograph.
If we all have an orange belt or something like that and see a guy running around without one we can boot him before anything goes down

Identifier should be easy to see. Can be as simple as a bright 2-3in ribbon on belt loop or arm....waist up. We won't have time to look for it. A blue ribbon tied with it optional. Yellow might be a good color...eady to see. No emblems, as they will only hurt us in the end. Just suggesting.

Paintball guns are just an idea for a non lethal option. Imagine having 200 people firing paintballs at them. I think they would disperse and we would stay out out of jail. Believe you me I'll be carrying too.

Paintball markers can be amped up to push more power- trust me - they freakin hurt and leave nasty ass bruises...
So for all of you paintball marker carriers- see if you can somehow get your hands on Dynasty‚Äôs Banana paint- it has a nasty chemical in it that causes cramping

Luckily there wasn't a lot of them or shit coulda went real bad real fast!
That was this last Saturday. Those things have only 1 entrance and exit. And they stalk you all the way up.
Best option I can think of is finding someone with a decent amount of private property on the other side of the river and shuttling people in and out.
Or get everyone to a platform and load an entire train so we got numbers stepping off all together

So the plan is to meet Saturday 10 am sharp at the Vancouver property
( 7415 NE 58Th st in Vancouver 10 am). The rally starts at 11am, so we don‚Äôt have much time so on the property we can fit around 80 cars there and have parking overflow at the mall .5 miles away.
So I want to have a quick meeting to go over the plan in place for the day of.
We are going to have 4 team leaders in place , a security detail leader, a mobile medic, and on site medic team
So at this rally it‚Äôs going to be 4 teams entering from different streets and different times roughly 15 minutes apart. So the team leader are the leads in place follow their orders please a lot of time has been put into this.
As far as long rifles and side arms, the only long rifles are going to be the security detail and all the conceal and open carry please no mag in it. Have it empty, and mag in your pocket during the day at the protest. There are going to be a lot of federal agents under cover in the crowds and police present so

There are going to be a lot of federal agents under cover in the crowds and police present so please have mags in pocket for when shit hits the fan.
We are going there not to engage but will retaliate if they engage. Please follow the team leaders, let them call the shot please. We want to keep this organized.
So this is from 11 am to 3 pm
And then we are going to have a night outing as well and location for that will be decided day of, depending on where we are needed.
Thank you everyone for contributing to this cause it will be big and heard
Just remember we are going to be have nation wide attention, So we need to be organized. There will be a ton of people there
But our fun will be Saturday night
Each group will park by there designated street entrance and walk in at there time with the group you are with so no one is alone
And no garage parking not safe
Park on street 3 blocks away and walk in safer that way. Everyone wear blue shirt, I think that will be the simplest to id
Everyone wear blue shirt, I think that will be the simplest to identify each other and we will have safe word in place if any one is in question day of.

So for today- here is what I need you guys to do- recruit- recruit- recruit... if you have ideas - please DM me or Dan... Trent is super busy today- he has lots going on- so let‚Äôs give him a break- thank you

Same with adding people - DM Dan or I about them... if you know them personally... if they are people from other groups you belong to- have them join our FB page so our mods can vet them and they can follow how to get here from there
Yes Mark we do... but will not be releasing that until closer to time- it‚Äôs for safety reasons
Also we will not know the target Antifa is planning to hit until Saturday- they don‚Äôt release that until the day off- so our leaders will be working on dialing in the evening plan during the daytime once the location of the hit is released

Remember everyone, we have a plan in place. I've shared the basic outline, we will go over details in person on Saturday. We're trying to limit how much is being said via tech.
Biggest thing to remember: during the rally at daytime we need to behave. Respond accordingly if they get aggressive with us, but don't be starting anything.
When night falls and they show up in their "battle rattle", that's when we can show them what happens when you step on the rattlesnake.

I would just need a secure offload site and designate the secured pick up site. Could also be a make shift infirmary/whatever.

It is important to keep in mind that Antifas shield defense is fundamentally weak as these half barrel shields allow for no overlap, which is the essence of its strength.

The reason they have a second behind them with pepper spray is that they know this.

They will enact a Cannae tactic.

What does this mean.

It means they will allow for breaks in their line, from which point surrounding elements and rear ranks will then isolate and engage with superior numbers.

Therefore all engagements with opposing shields must not be done cowboy style.

It must remain measured, tight and controlled. Once a general engagement is joined the line must then deploy in wolf packs of 3 to 4 combatants , allowing for local superiority of attack and defense.

My military historian coupled with intimate knowledge of Black Bloc tactics 2 cents ;)

I was once arrested in Oregon at a boat launch, after a fight(that was self defense) because the OSP said I took "steps of aggression" I had moved from my original spot of word exchange to approx 5 ft away, but it was to flag a boat not to argue with her or fight The woman came clear across the parking lot and I waited til she swung first before unloading till knocking her out. A large crowd had gathered for her reunion, After fight n before before police arrived and they were extremely aggressive toward cops. I think they only arrested us both because they got scared of crowd violence and couldn't more backup. One was sheriff, one was OSP. Anyhow, the officer told me that advancing in her direction (and he didn't let me even explain why I had moved) was the reason I was charged. It was dropped later but I did have to post $1,000.00 cash bail until court. That was returned minus a few bucks. So just make sure it's self defense without advancing.
Also if a self defense fight is separated it is like a reset, have to show its self defense if contact made again. Police won't likely do much and if they do, it'll be slow. They mentioned a lot of paperwork to do.

I helped plan the event and get people to defend it. There is no fore warning of any support group presence. The streamers are trusted, conservative friends that regularly stream riots and are fed up. They know the drill. They are there for the event for 2 reasons, one of the speakers, who is black went viral after being at protest, trying to speak against violence/ destruction and who was chanted over, pushed out by blm's little punks. They want her message shared out to community. The other reason is they want to show the BLM violence toward everyone who doesn't agree or dares speak differently in "their town". BLM/ant-thugs will attack verbally at 1st, and get in your face with their phone while antagonizing, etc. But they're cowards here unless they outnumber targets.
Nothing has been said outside this group about who is coming nor about anything after rally. That's why PT News keeps saying it's pointless to do a day rally.

We will be under a microscope because of lies that we will prove wrong about us!! You are all so appreciated! I know it's a lot to ask. We will be okay! I've been out there with a lot less and was just fine. They will taunt, antagonize, act a fool. We are the bigger people. Your leaders are the best! They've worked tirelessly. So Relax, it's going to be a great rally because we are not just neighbors and friends, we are courageous men and women who represent. It's an honor to stand with each of you against the false narrative, violence, destruction corruption, lies, racists, haters and the evil and for our heroes who's hands are tied.

Watching some of the feed, it seems that situation level was raised to riot very quickly , which is a good thing.

They have clearly had enough of this , which bodes well for future blue support actions , though we must be just as cognizant of the rapid escalation and subsequent response.

We are here to make a change, laws will be broken, people will get hurt... It's lawlessness downtown, and people need to be prepared for bad things... they are ready to do bad things to us.

@Mark Melchi - I believe Trent is talking about the rally and we are to follow ALL rules at that time... no reason to get spot lighted...

Thanks to every one of you who excepted the challenge of coming to Portland today . The war here is ugly as fuck and bigger than most believe when I tell them . Hundreds of real men and women showed up and had my back as I had there's. Today we fought evil at the door with courage , vengeance and at times rage . The whole dam country heard us few today say fuck off and let's go ! . When yellowed showed up I was blown away as tiny said probably 30 would show. Well I think all of them did lol and it was a honor to fight along with you all. Keep the fight up as I will and remember you'll be remembered in history as evil will be stopped. Sincerely11/b

Alright, us medford guys are home. Thanks for being there today. Each and every one of you kicked ASS. Today was not a defeat or a loss, it was a complete victory. We completed our objective, freaked the living hell out of ANTIFA, and we conducted ourselves the way we want patriots to be viewed.
Even though their side of the media is portraying it as a victory for them, they're only showing the last 10-15 minutes of the day. For over three hours we held the line!!!
You all did a fine job today. I'm proud to stand with you!

What about some of those small GPS tags??
They could be stuck to BLM vehicles and we could start seeing where the group up and find their bases of operations.
The car with the girl sitting on it might be a good one.
The BLM "snack van" that rings in all their chemicals and explosives.

Also, I noticed that all the explosives and paint balls were coming from the groups of umbrellas. We need a way to combat that. The "fire extinguisher" would have been a good one for that.
Or maybe we need a couple 20 gauges with rubber bullets. When the umbrellas group up, a half dozen rubber rounds might make them think twice about it.

Lets not over think this. Antifa has been fighting the cops and feds for 90 days and are very good against hold the line tactics and will sit there all day and throw shit at us. What they don't do well with is when they get rushed we need numbers and fighters we will crush them in the charge

Mark Melchi
No, what we need is to stop playing games by the rules, envelop them on a few sides so you don't face their stupid shield wall and beat the crap out of them, just go around the wall.
Avatar
Richard Bowman II
@David Willis you are correct in this assesment. During the several times they forced our hands to push back their line we had them well beyond their lines and into the park. A few of them stood and dropped quickly, but the majority of them stumbled over themselves in retreat. We could have reformed a line and pushed them back beyond the van , which would have cut them off from their supply of mace , projectiles and other assorted trash.

That was until DHS gassed us and we had to pull back.

Ironic really , that the folks Antifa were there to protest turned out to be their best defenders

@Mark Melchi honestly their "shield wall" , at least from my position, was perhaps 15 people, 9 of which from a count were small girls.

When we charged the line their shields fell back at a run, they didnt even try to hold

Right, but having different sides envelope them at the same time they won't have enough assets/spray, or kids to focus on all sides. The police asked us to stay on one side, but next time, we don't need to follow that guidance since we just need to go after them and end these domestic terrorist.

There is so many different ways we can go about it next time. Shield wall, proud boy's as bat brigade, and the paintballers in the rear.
Shield wall up and once it escalates have another group run in from nowhere and hit them from rear.
Upon our departure it drew the the true agitators of violence while greatly reducing their numbers and we can use that to our advantage also.

That would have been great to push them back behind the van, close the wall and then gave those 2 fuckers 5 seconds to exit the vehicle. lol It would have just been them 2 and all of the Patriots. ü§£
It's much harder for us because we actually care about people. We are considering the fact that there are teenager's there. It's easy for them because they don't give a shit who they hurt. Thank's for showing us that though because now we can give some sort of warning after they start attacking. You stay in the game after that then we return fire. They get lit up then it's on them.

You know as everyone was retreating and being chased down the street by BLM we were up on hill by PPD. It would be easy to have had a group come from behind then...and then the front group turn back and trap them in the middle. Again though...numbers, equipment, and communication is needed.

I'm about to publicly announce my total ignorance concerning paintballing and paintball guns. Does freezing them cause them to jam up?
Avatar

Rubber rounds are more expensive. We would need to take up a collection for that. And limit it to a couple guys who are cool headed enough to just track the umbrella brigade and their paintball markers.
And maybe a few of the more serious agitators coming at our shield wall with the stun batons.
No!
They do not jam up.
Just have to freeze them slowly.
Fridge first, or ice bath. Then freezer.
Problem is, they don't stay frozen for long.
Once they thaw, they start coming apart too easily.
Best thing is to get in the thicker paintballs that allow us to crono our guns up a ways and cause I bit more sting.

We would learn to act and move as a team instead of finally meeting face to face 1 hour before doing battle together.

So a date has to be picked and everyone who wants to do this needs to get the day off. Whatever it takes.

What we really need for training is a warehouse or urban setting. Whenever I do training for my guys down here in so Oregon, I try to focus on hand to hand and pistols. But when SHTF its not gonna be out in the woods, its gonna be in the streets. I had my guys watch documentaries on the battle of Stalingrad to give them an idea of what it would be like.

So on one hand we are the militant arm of the Proud Boys , and now we are being represented in a video implying that we are Qanon followers misrepresenting Qanon with violence.

Meanwhile everyone involved failed to notice exactly what I told one of those Antifa kids.

That we are a grassroots response of proud patriots that despite its growing pains and flaws believe wholeheartedly in the American promise as it was framed by our founders and most sacred documents for ALL people.

That we too may agree that there are some things that could change for the better so that all may be proud, prosperous and free.

But so long as their solution to our social ills is the toxic top down slavery of communism and the immolatiom of our most sacred liberties and promises upon the pyre of our beloved flag soaked with the blood of countless patriots.

We promise. We will ALWAYS oppose them.

If you are part of the groups who had the different rally‚Äôs on Saturday- give them a heads up that they have massive trolls... they are bickering back and forth as to who failed their event the most and ANTIFA has screen shifted it and has it blasted all over Twitter...

I just want to give them a heads up... also- PLEASE do not go comment on the threads or any threads or live streams about who actually organized the Patriots... we have a PIC (media) for this... so please do not speak for the group or about the group... it‚Äôs for our safety, which we have worked hard to maintain...

You all are family and we must stick together- let our PIC (media) handle this.... If you know of anyone who is actually wanting to speak to ‚Äúanyone‚Äù from this group- please PM me and I will handle it...

Oh of course. To clarify the above, or something to its effect , was spoken in an exchange with some kid calling us the Proud Boys " bully squad" just there to beat people up, and a question as to why we are fighting them.

I refused all press statements , and will of course continue to do so, and gave no names of any organization involved, especially our own.

They get brave because they dont understand why we are there. Saturday we were there not to fighr but to defend, if that defense required offense then so be it.

When our mission was fulfilled we withdrew from the theater( we can address what went wrong there later) .

Antifa sees this as a retreat.

They later marched through the streets chanting we beat back the fascists.

They thought they " beat" us

You can make your own filters for gas masks pretty easily. A brillo sponge pad does the trick.

I still have plenty of contacts back home in Chicago. It would appear that much of the more malicious rioting is being carried out by legit inner city gang bangers , far harder and willing to go much further than the punk rock rejects that comprise much of Antifa in Portland.

Kenosha knew this and wasted little time deploying the guard , but the situation is rapidly escalating amidst rekindling unrest in Chicago proper which just played host to 66 shootings this weekend alone .
The live feed and the reactions reveal a marked difference between those out to play and those hellbent on large scale destruction.

Unlike what we have seen in Portland, there are no DJ's , no dance parties, no Trump balloons, just laser guided violence and chaos.

This is not to downplay the Portland issue , but rather to draw attention to the fact that such escalation may trigger higher levels of aggression from the opposition, including in Portland, Denver, Seattle , L.A. etc.

Remember, for them this is the incubation stage of a Revolution. We have every reason to believe they have yet to show their hand.

They have been at their training for years, including an active gym in Chicago and somewhere in Portland.

I have no doubt that they have something in reserve that is being witheld for a future state of escalation, but for now all the training in the world wont make up for the lack of heart they frequently display.

There is a reasin their mantra is not, strength, but rather SAFETY in numbers as that is typically their only saving grace.

I'm loving increased showing of patriotism and backing of the blue!
But, we have to understand every time we show up in force to every flag wave we just draw antifa to us. Therefore putting patients who aren't there to fight in danger. We can't stop anyone from going, that's your right, but just be aware the Coalition can't come out to every single flag wave/rally. ANTIFA is expecting that, and are watching for that. We can't become predictable.
If you do go to these events, be smart. Keep your head on a swivel. Don't do anything alone. Antifa is trying to goad patriots into firing a shot, so we look like the bad guys. Especially after the past week.
Putting patriots* not patients

Nothing is planned for this group for a couple of weeks... we have to let some people heal... 2 of our heads need time and we will not be doing any more until they do. One has a broken hand and another has a fx arm... so I‚Äôm making the call that we will not be doing anything until they are good to go... we have a date coming up and we will go ahead with that... BUT these rally‚Äôs and flag waves we will not be going. There is elderly and children there and when we show up or Antifa knows we are showing up, we are putting them in danger. I refuse to do that! So if you chose to go as an individual that is ok but it won‚Äôt have our group there or our leaders. As the ‚Äúmomma bear‚Äù as it seems my new name is- this does stress me out because I watch these live streams and I want to get there when trouble starts and go guns a blazing to get you out of there.

So here is how you change your name in the groups- this has to be done in each group, not just one but ALL
Tap the top banner of each group- go into your settings- then go edit your profile- you will see your name there- click on your name and change it.. also it is good to clear your chat history often!
That is also in the settings- this way if some gets a hold of your phone - and hack into it- there is nothing for them to see.. please do this often. Thank you

We all know something is coming. Hell, its already here. I have no desire to fight fellow Americans, but I will to protect the American way of life.
To quote from the movie "The Patriot": "This war will be fought not on the frontier or on some distant battlefield, but amongst us -- among our homes."
I hate to see this happen here, but I will gladly die to protect my fellow Americans, my fellow patriots.
Sorry, in an odd mood today. I didn't know Jay Bishop, but a patriot died at the hands of a piece of shit commie. And its hitting me hard.

You know, I have burned bridges because of my political beliefs. I was raised to know right from wrong. I am not a racist. I am a law abiding Patriot who loves her country and if it doesn't fit into your agenda then go on your way. My heart has been breaking all day for the Patriot who was murdered in Portland. I will give my life for my believes. I am proud to be an American.
Whitebear woman was an Indian name given to me by a dear friend. I feel the need to use it now.

These people aren't fellow Americans. It's not some policy disagreement or about taxes. It's about the destruction of our nation. Pure and simple. There are two ways to deal with them.
1) Let them continue
2) Remove them from existence

There are a few things that I believe need to be addressed. So please bare with me.
** There is a lot of new people joining our group. Everyone needs to be aware that each person we add have been through a vetting process, a process that hasn‚Äôt let us down yet. We have very dedicated mods who take this task very seriously and who are absolutely amazing! So please give a shout out to our mods and thank them - they keep us safe.
** Belonging to this group there is certain expectations we have for each and everyone of you.
First- our group name and members stay out of any conversations with people or groups. Other groups do not vet like we do and have had people get into their groups because of this. So PLEASE do not talk about what we talk about or what we are planning with ANY other group. Our leaders do communicate with other group leaders and we do work with them.
Second- If we find out that information is being leaked out to others or other groups.
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY WARNING. You will be removed from our group immediately.
Third- Do NOT share information as to rallys or needing people to show here or there. This causes chaos amongst everyone and makes our phones light up like a Christmas tree. If there is any sort of intel or information you have please message one of us personally- we will then give it to our intel team to dig into and verify.
Fourth- We believe that anyone who wants to be a patriot can be- from being a prayer warrior to bring boots on the ground- we do not turn anyone away, unless they can not be vetted of course.
Fifth- Just because you invited people to the group does not mean they get an automatic pass- so please do not send us a message stating you invited so n so and you vouch for them. If you think about it, how many of you would know me from Adam on the street? How many know if I‚Äôm male or female? Do you see where I am going here?
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è I have met a lot of you, but you haven‚Äôt even realized it.
Sixth- Here is our heads/leads- and if they say something you can bet it has been ran past all of us and they need to be respected. Trent aka Spartan, Dan aka Bravo91, Chris Tough, Joe W, John aka JH, Pat aka John Elway.
Eighth- Do not post your personal address or phone numbers- PM the person you are wanting to give this information to.
Ninth- When we are called out as a group- PLEASE PLEASE mask up- hide your identity.
Tenth- We will never stop you or say you can not go to any events or rally‚Äôs/flag waves, we are not her to dictate, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we will not worry about you. We also will never say you can not be part of other groups as well... but we ARE saying that what is said in here is NOT to be told to other groups.
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
Eleventh- Please do not post stating that you could use some help at events or up coming events to the entire group- please pass that along to us- we may have something in the works and getting ready to release it to the group.
Twelfth- We do have fun- we do joke around and we do chatter a lot. What we are doing is important- we do wish we could go to each and every event, but sometimes our prescience makes things worse. We are not a group that wants to stir the pot or cause trouble but we are a group that will go in to help stop an issue before it starts.

@Dub we will come out of this on top, but we will carry ourselves in such a way as to come out on the right side of history, as a bastion of defense before the fall of the Republic, and when the hand of the patriot is forced to act it WILL be as the defenders of the founding, for we cannot allow or enemies to cast us as the aggressor.

Remember the movies scenes of both full metal jacket and saving private ryan. The scene where the sniper shoots the squad member then hopes to lure in the other squad members trying to save the wounded ? I hate basing real life on a movie scene but it fits this narrative. We are better than they. We will fight smarter, not harder. We will not risk our lives to defeat them, we will force them to risk theirs. Revenge is a meal best served cold. Just like the movie scenes, they want to lure us in. To make us look like wild rednecks at large. Remember Lavoy Finicum. Remember how they demonized that effort. We can't afford to lose anymore patriots and then get spit on afterwards. I am deeply saddened by this shooting. I want to make them pay, but we cannot tarnish our efforts to fulfill our taste for retribution.

I think that would be a serious mistake on their part.
We are all practicing extreme tolerance... especially after what happened to Jay.

People will protect their homes, no matter what race, religion, or political party.

If they cross that line, they will lose.

We live very rural, but we are locked, loaded and ready to protect those we love if need be.
Hopefully it won‚Äôt come to that.

Listening to Ted Wheeler go on and on about the unrest in Portland being linked to the presence of Trump in the white house and the muder ( did I miss the trial or something, as that is a bold and unfounded claim) of George Floyd , and how he will " bring us back together"

Okay...

1. If the President has anything to do with their "ire" , welp it turns out we dont solve such issues by way of Marxist uprisings and militant juntas.

2. The issue of Antifa will never be resolved should it remain undiagnosed, that being they are a radical communist organization no different than the Red Guard, Khmer rouge, Bolsheviks etc , whose sole interest is the overthrow of this nation and every semblance of its founding, something Marx himself used to stew over.

The point is , these people cannot be reasoned with nor are they any longer able to be considered our countrymen, for while we believe they are wrong, they believe we are evil and will continue to act accordingly.

There has been mention of understanding the psyche and motivations of your enemy. If you have not done so already, I would emcourage struggling through the tract of hate which is the Communist manifesto, and do some reading in Marxist youth movements , such as the aforementioned Red Guard under Mao, Bolsheviks under Lenin and Trotsky, the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot and even Mussolinis Black Shirts to obtain a portrait of our opposition.

Some of these practices were instituted in our school system, years ago, in an effort to manipulate thought processing over generations. Its desensitized the hearts of our youth. By removing parenting from families, and consequences for actions, to down right disrespect for authority. Generations before us would have already removed the political Marxist uprising.

I can understand their position, its too bad they can't understand that for every whimpy transplant scared of the good guys there are many more that are safer because of the few who are willing to call out the state funded coup for what it is and stand in the gap for those who need our protection. Eventually even they will understand the importance of an armed civilian force. The one our founding fathers established in the constitution.. we are the line.

People are moving out of and into our State by the droves.

Our title company just said that 75-80% of their deals right now are people moving here from back East.

The driving factors are:

1. People have discovered that they can work from home.

2. Oregon has become THE go-to State for people under 40 who make more than 100k a year.

3. People are moving out because of the extreme Democratic rule.

Its somehow breaking news that police officers are human, and following nearly 100 days of vicious attacks, dehumanizing remarks from the very top of our society, flagrant accusations, belittlement, threat and assaults of a physical as well as psychological nature an officer might have enough.
The campaign to point the officers and now the patriots as the antgonizers and the aggressors in amplifying rapidly, ad THIS requires serious investigation, not so much a violent actions and provocations of BLM / Antifa

With their interest focused toward looking like the victims and we the aggressors, which is the theme of their event in Eugene in sept 4 , expect them to hang around and try to get photos of attendees but nothing like a bloc deployment , unless of course they are given a reason to once again look the victim simply defending themselves.

With a full black bloc call out their focus seems to be on the Eugene deal

Listen up Patriots.
Due to new developments in the past few days we are suspending all Coalition activities until we have a meeting with all of the heads of the different groups that make up the Patriots Coalition of the PNW. We kicked the hornets nest when we went into Portland, and there had been some ramifications from it. I know we all want to be out there fighting the good fight, but there's some backlash that could land Patriots in jail and legal battles. We're not giving up or standing down, just wanting to put our heads together and have a proper plan moving forward.
Now we can't tell you to not do anything, that's your decision and your right. Just know if you guys do anything on your own, it can't be done with the support of the Coaliton. This sucks, I know, but we have to play it smart right now
We need to think about our families safety and well being.
Again, we're NOT GIVING UP, just recollecting ourselves and planning on how to best move forward. You all have been doing awesome and working hard and all of the leadership appreciates and recognizes it. You have to pick your battles.
A few of the factors regarding our decision on this are as follows
Sep 2, 11:50 AM
Avatar
Dan-Medford
1) Local government is placing the blame for the violence in Portland on Patriots. They want a scapegoat, and they want to throw us to the wolves
2) OSP has been deputized by the federal government, meaning they're no longer held to Browns restrictions and can prosecute anyone arrested at a federal level. (No more catch and release)
3) Antifa has declared "open season" on Patriots. "See a nazi (patriot), take 'em out"
We need to be smart so there's not more Patriots lying dead in the street.
I hate us having to go into standby like this, but I'd hate to see more Patriots in jail for doing what's right

I highly recommend having local organizations. If your homes/businesses are under threat definitely defend it.
The coalition just can't be making large scale operations like that one Saturday.

For those of you that live in the outskirts of town, in areas of quiet neighborhoods. Areas where folks can go about their business without notice. There have been unverified reports of groups of antifa- like people organizing, training and gathering in these types of places. I will not go into detail until I have confirmed intelligence to prove factual information. But I wish you all will investigate any unusual activity in your part of the world. I am hoping this is an overreactive concern and we all can relax.. but if not, I don't want my brothers and sisters caught off guard.

I hear alot of talk about brothers and sisters here. But i cant get a damn one of you to contact me. If your not aware of who i am. Im just a patriot like the rest of you, but possibly more so than some. Apparently. I waa at the no goal Eugene excursion. And I'm the Fuck you, Fuck you, And Fuck you driver of the silver F-350 in the MAGA comes to Portland compilation and took down the pos throwing projectiles at parade vehicles, our wonderful governor broadcasted about stopping violence in portland. Ive proved my patriotism. All while running a business and you know. Adultng. Ive given my contact information. Nothing. Ive posted here. Nothing. So heres my last ditch effort. Although it sounds like operations are ceasing .. I would like to be contacted by Portland/Vancouver leadership. Cody Benson im in the hillsboro area. You and anyone else in this area. Or not. Labor day parade? 5033416906

Whoa- cool you‚Äôre jets- I HAVE responded to you and I HAVE told you that we don‚Äôt have a specific ‚Äúleader‚Äù in Portland area that we don‚Äôt have sections as we use to... I also informed you that as soon as we got back we would be having a meeting.. so you HAVE been contacted... and NO ONE is more of a Patriot than another... so calling leaders out in a thread like this is inappropriate and WILL NOT be tolerated when you have spoken to me

There are a few things that I believe need to be addressed. So please bare with me.
** There is a lot of new people joining our group. Everyone needs to be aware that each person we add have been through a vetting process, a process that hasn‚Äôt let us down yet. We have very dedicated mods who take this task very seriously and who are absolutely amazing! So please give a shout out to our mods and thank them - they keep us safe.
** Belonging to this group there is certain expectations we have for each and everyone of you.
First- our group name and members stay out of any conversations with people or groups. Other groups do not vet like we do and have had people get into their groups because of this. So PLEASE do not talk about what we talk about or what we are planning with ANY other group. Our leaders do communicate with other group leaders and we do work with them.
Second- If we find out that information is being leaked out to others or other groups
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY WARNING. You will be removed from our group immediately.
Third- Do NOT share information as to rallys or needing people to show here or there. This causes chaos amongst everyone and makes our phones light up like a Christmas tree. If there is any sort of intel or information you have please message one of us personally- we will then give it to our intel team to dig into and verify.
Fourth- We believe that anyone who wants to be a patriot can be- from being a prayer warrior to bring boots on the ground- we do not turn anyone away, unless they can not be vetted of course.
Fifth- Just because you invited people to the group does not mean they get an automatic pass- so please do not send us a message stating you invited so n so and you vouch for them. If you think about it, how many of you would know me from Adam on the street? How many know if I‚Äôm male or female? Do you see where I am going here?
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è I have met a lot of you, but you haven‚Äôt even realized it.
Sixth- Here is our heads/leads- and if they say something you can bet it has been ran past all of us and they need to be respected. Trent aka Spartan, Dan aka Bravo91, Chris Tough, Joe W, John aka JH, Pat aka John Elway.
Eighth- Do not post your personal address or phone numbers- PM the person you are wanting to give this information to.
Ninth- When we are called out as a group- PLEASE PLEASE mask up- hide your identity.
Tenth- We will never stop you or say you can not go to any events or rally‚Äôs/flag waves, we are not her to dictate, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we will not worry about you. We also will never say you can not be part of other groups as well... but we ARE saying that what is said in here is NOT to be told to other groups.
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
Eleventh- Please do not post stating that you could use some help at events or up coming events to the entire group- please pass that along to us- we may have something in the works and getting ready to release it to the group.
Twelfth- We do have fun- we do joke around and we do chatter a lot. What we are doing is important- we do wish we could go to each and every event, but sometimes our prescience makes things worse. We are not a group that wants to stir the pot or cause trouble but we are a group that will go in to help stop an issue before it starts.

Dub, i know this is a good group. Thats why im still here. And i had no intention of being on television. But, it is what it is. I was questioning going to this next parade. But my sons and a few of their friends are going. Although the parade isn't supposed to go thru Multnomah county. It wasn't supposed to Saturday either. If anyone is attending. Be nice to have a group that is aware of their tactics. Its not going to go unchallenged. Regardless of
Skipping downtown. Portland is ground zero. It would be nice, if nothing else. To share contact info with other vetted patriots who might attend local events. I recognized their tactics. Many didn't and some people got hurt. Pics of license plates..... on one you tube video, a guy is seen punching a blm member in the street. He was taken out pic takers of plates and people blocking the parade. Classic!!! Hit and run.

Our guy said he heard "rumors" of the violence and destruction, but wanted to see for himself since the headlines are about peaceful protests for equality. He got hit with a potato by a passing BLM car at the Sandy flag wave

Something to keep in mind when randomly handing out body armor to people who may be thinking passionately rather than logically if people don't know their backgrounds.
If a Felon is found during an event and is wearing a vest, they're facing a 3 year federal sentence. Even if charges with nothing else.
Penalties increase substantially if the person was wearing a vest while being accused of committing another felony, like say... Arson.

On the fundraiser, I put that i knew him, i used a generic email. I said that this gofundme is a front for a radical, "direct action" group suspected in recent criminal activities that included arson, looting and assaults on local citizens, businesses and law enforcement in Portland, OR and have traveled to other cities to create anarchy. This group is currently under investigation by local and federal law enforcement for these alleged activities with more anarchy planned.
This gear will be used for organized unlawful events backed by radical left wing leaders, not by peaceful protestors.
Gofundme should not be allowing organized criminals to raise funding that will be used in illegal activities.

For anyone thinking about getting AR500 armor: I'm on week 9 of 8, and week 5 of 2 for my carrier. They said they were both going to go out at the same time around the 28th of last month, haven't seen any updates on my profile about them actually shipping.

Heads up from the local news. For those of you intending to attend the patriot activities in Portland this weekend, when asked about the situation PPB representative responded that they believed there would be ZERO chance of no violence erupting, therefore expect a large and highly responsive force of police, newly deputized troopers and federal marshalls bringing the hammer down heavy.

Please act responsibly, lower the temperature as and where you are able , and remember, even though you are attending as a private citizen, please keep in mind that your actions may and likely will still reflect upon the coalition and its membership as a whole ,therefore conduct yourself in a manner befitting a proud and honour bound patriot.

I‚Äôm glad we got through, but I am worried about the line of cars coming from each direction as it seems they started getting more and more agitated.. they are A LOT bigger over here than Portland, but damn they definitely do not shower over here either- they freaking stink!!!.... but we are safe now.. we will keep you updated if we run into any more trouble.

Hmmm that group is of course both militant and radical after the fashion of the Panthers under Carmichael in the 60s ,but I dont know that they have been linked to illegal activities, looting, rioting and unrest.

I am not sure that patriot militias openly confronted them is either prudent in ones choice of battles nor is it good PR in the current climate of everything being on the head of patriots.

If this pops off it is going to be placed squarely at the feet of good Americans as the narrative dictates that their presence was a provocation of violence.

It may be best to hold ones offensive hand close to the chest in the lead up to November, to be placed on the table when it really counts.

Either way, may the folks out there one the lines be safe

The differences between the major hubs of I -5 , being Portland, Salem and Eugene, have irreconcilable differences with the lions share of the rest of the state.

Though little good comes from the breakup of the Union , self determination must be maintained, therefore at this juncture it is best that Portland be allowed to establish itself as the Peoples Republic of Portland, or whatever Bolshevik bullshit they want, and the rest of the state carry on.

For me today is hard last night a true patriot was involved in a hit-and-run I do not know the details however I have gotten news that he is in critical condition my deepest condolences to his friends and family I did not know his name until yesterday and the reason that I'm saying this is because a couple weeks ago I was at the back and blue rally providing security for the speakers and as you all know to whoever was there it was hell.... During the last half an hour about us exiting the Justice center I was attacked with bear mace to the point where I could not open my eyes because of how painful it was someone grabbed me and let me away from the danger I was a blind man walking I could hear the sprays of the bear mace about 20 yards off I started communicating with these guys it turned out they were proud boys they took me under their wing they defended me and they helped me get to safety this man was with me the whole entire time if it was not for him and the
He gave me the last remaining water to help clear my eyes so that I could go and find you guys at the rally point I am truly saddened but this horrific event but I also am enraged I have no words for the low-life scumbags who terrorized this nation in this country the good men and women Port fighting to preserve what are fore fathers gave to us

On Saturday, September 5, 2020, Oregon State Police assisted our partners at Portland Police Bureau with the rioters in Portland. This criminal activity presented an extreme danger to life safety for all community members, and prompted a declaration of a riot.

Individuals within the crowd began throwing illegal fireworks/mortars at officers. Others were seen throwing rocks. At least one had a "wrist-rocket" type of slingshot launching unknown objects. In order to defend themselves from these assaults, officers used crowd control munitions, including tear gas. Officers made numerous targeted arrests.

Rioters lit fires in the streets, including dumpsters, garbage cans, and wooden pallets. Officers moved in to push the crowd back in order to extinguish the fires.

During numerous confrontations with officers, individuals launched attacks on law enforcement, including throwing objects. A sergeant was directly struck by a commercial grade firework, which burned through his glove and injured his hand (photos). Several officers and troopers were struck by rocks in the head, arms, shoulders, and feet. Only their protective gear prevented serious injury. An Oregon State Police vehicle was damaged by rocks, including broken windows and dents (photos). An un-exploded mortar was recovered by police (photo).

Over 50 people were arrested. At least two were wearing body armor. One had a dagger, another had a knife (photos).

The response to this event included not only Portland Police Rapid Response Team and Oregon State Police, but PPB precincts had to pull officers out of patrol to assist. That limited the ability to respond to calls. At about 2:00 A.M., there were almost 150 calls for service holding in the City of Portland.

Yes, going after them at night is the solution. Day time yelling matches are pointless. Like we do in other states, tactical ambushes at night while backing up the police are key. You get the leaders and the violent ones and the police are happy to shut their mouths and cameras. They are starting to murder us and peaceful ways are over, Guerilla tactics are the only way we win this.
We are seriously loosing this country...and if we are too worried about getting in trouble we have already let them win.

As I've said before, antifa and blm are increasing in size and tactics because they are well funded, and better organized.
The only reason they are better organized is because they have a plethora of obedient minions. They will follow the lemmings off the cliff.
Our issue, currently, is we have free thinkers with excellent ideas and options, yet no collusion. This group is making excellent strides in fixing those issues by appointing the initial leadership to get things in motion. In the past I have absolutely refused to join any group with the intention to rally for attention. Times have changed and the rallies are turning into security details to be allowed to speak in a fascist environment. We...may become the patriotic antifa. I have just wanted to live and let live but recently I am being pushed to go along with a group or be assaulted or restricted from being free. There are a lot of us out there. The ones that just want be be invisible.
But ....we are being forced to leave the shadows.

I have been reading and watching a lot of people post videos take pictures screenshots and go about saying how they back the blue how they are patriots when is the time that actions speak louder than words people need to understand that if it's not us then who will stand because if we do not stand did I feel and I know that this will happen later but only be ten times worse so again I asked who will stand shoulder-to-shoulder who will stand shield to shield against this infectious disease
They are a lot of people saying that they are Patriots but don't want to come out and join the rallies when is the correct time to where actions speak louder than words

Its our families, our friends.
They are the ones we fight to protect. We can't meet these punks head on until we're properly coordinated, equipped, and have a plan.
Which is in the works.
If we go at them half cocked, sure we'll kick their butts, but then they retaliate like rats. Run away, the sue our families, attack our livelihoods, and then move to being a thorn in our every day life.

So I usually don‚Äôt soap box on here.
Most everyone in here I have stood shoulder to shoulder with at some point or another. Trent, Dan and myself have put a great amount of work in so when we do engage we will be successful. As of right now I‚Äôve raised enough money to get us 16 gas masks. There is other planning and communication with other groups that has to happen, we must be smart, we must be tactful how we proceed. Everyone here has taken risk by being on the front lines. I‚Äôd love to go get a few sticks of dynamite and head to Portland. While I was out of town working two men tried to break into my home, they came back two days later in broad daylight. My wife was smart and handled it very well. From how she did described them I believe them to be local antifa. We also had a man taking photos of our home the week before this happened.
I would love to go out a catch those two fucks, believe me I tried. At this point my anger has cooled and knowing what and how we are proceeding gives me comfort. Pleas be patient and know that the leads in this group are working as hard as everyone else to bring this to fruition.

Paintballs are rubber balls for paintball guns
Probably some more batons or tasers would always be nice

Here is what I am finding and confirmed.. Antifa is calling for everyone to go to the capital and defend... and to bring ‚Äúhot soup‚Äù aka Molotov Cocktails. The ones who can not make it to Salem are to stop the Trump caravan that is heading there from Oregon City. They are being told to do what ever they have to, to stop them. There is a handful of Antifa videoing and mixing in with the Patriots getting names, faces and vehicle information and putting it out for their ‚Äúintel‚Äù to find who they are and where they live. I haven‚Äôt seen anything yet on Thurston/Springfield/Eugene area yet that has been confirmed because they to are calling for their people to head to Salem.

On another note, a group I am in is complying a list of patriotic and constitutionalist groups who may need legal assistance in the future, as we saw with Kenosha and PDX how important it is for us to be represented.

Gion festival, Kyoto, Japan, 1864

Insurrectionist intent on overthrowing the sitting government hatched a plan of confusion and subversion that involved the setting of a series of uncontrollable fires that would not only cause destruction , but drain resources and distract from their actions.

Opposing the insurrectionists stood the Shinsengumi volunteer patriotic corps.

Known as the Shoguns last Samurai corps, they were the strongest group of swordsmen in Japanese history.

The plot was exposed and the enemies of patriotism and order crushed in a decisive clash of blades that left near 20 and the streets awash with blood in the newly risen sun.

Fast forward to 2020 . The names and place have changed but patriotism ALWAYS remains the same.

Stay vigilant.

So when we went yesterday to get our mustang (thanks Ken), noticed 5 vehicles with folks that made me suspicious. Young, masked, and black girl in one of them. My thought was, starting fires ans then ransacking evacuated homes. We started packing early Tues morning 0200, power had been out since 2200. Daughter and animals are all upset. Rough night with high winds and branches and trees falling. Noticed how portland wasn't as affected by fires ü§¨üò° My service dog wouldn't leave my side she knew something was up. I have lung issues from Iraq, got really sick last night and ongoing migraine. Stay safe everyone. We all want a end to these evil brainwashed domestic terrorists.

@Iron Wolf 9 , reading your post regarding the diversionary tactics of fire setting to drain and redirect resources reminds me of the balloon bombs of the Japanese. They sent incendiary bombs by ballon from Japan to cause large scale fires on the west coast in an effort to redirect and drain resorses. In fact the only fatalities from that war were right here in Oregon, caused when a church group, kids, found one of the bombs.

I just got off of the phone with Springfield Police. At the moment none of Springfield is at a level.. albeit that can change rapidly. She told me that the emergency management folk are having a meeting in the next hour. She advised me that the web site LaneCo.Org is our best place for information. She states that they are looking to the side of caution, and that we could move to a level 1 after this meeting. She also stated that it is not a bad idea to gather important papers, valuables and pets.

We also live on a quiet street and if you have a trailer or MH it can be parked on the street- we can get you power and water in your holding tanks.. a dump station is only 5 min away

To echo @Patriot Coalition it has been a source of pride and invigoration to see everyone opening and offering their hands, help , homes and resources to one another and our communities.

This is what living the Coalitions message in realtime looks like, and there is ZERO doubt we will all come out of this on the other side bruised, but stronger, together.

The word needs to be spread that if you witness someone trying to start a fire, they need to defuse the situation asap. Kind of pointless to call the cops now. We are the defenders of our own life. We cannot sit back and watch our state burn. Gear up. Scan your sector's and by any means possible, neutralize the threat.

This holiday fire has 80 firemen workin it when there should b 1000 for its size. Word from the stater was they planned on letting it burn through the mohawk

Something to think about: as we evacuate ourselves, families, and friends, secure our homes and property, shake the ash off our livestock, let's pause and first, be thankful for what we have and the ability to defend it, but also realize where we are at from a tacticl position. We are distracted and our forces are thin just one day before a target date for our enemy. Please be vigilant, and ready, if possible, to give aide to our community, fellow Patriots, and law enforcement.

A really good friend of the family post this after someone basically called him a liar. Scott Dunn Decided to stay at home last night to protect my family home and the animals we have. It was a long night in the dark with no power and the smoke was pretty intense. Woke up to a phone call from Melissa Connole Kelly stating the fire crews had to retreat due to dangerous conditions and I needed to leave. Drove around to look at the area and look for visible fire, non found. As I‚Äôm locking my gate up a sheriff stops to check on me and we talked for a while. What I heard him tell me was mind blowing. He literally said they are finding staging areas with explosives, petrochemicals and wine bottles filled with gasoline. Not just randomly but all over our area. He told me these fires are not behaving in ways normal fires grow, they start in odd locations all within feet of roadways or pathways.

I have no doubt that they willing and able to do just that. First responders need to have their focus on saving lives and buildings. If we see anyone trying to commit arson, ziptie their ass to a tree, light pole, or anything they can't escape from. Take pictures of them and their arson tools, then find law enforcement explaining that you just made a citizen's arrest. Then take them back to the person in custody.

The main focus for us is to be helping our communities in any way we can. Be it running supplies, giving out proper info, or helping with fire suppression and/or evacuations (trent and i have been doing the latter for the past two days when not working).

The best part about that report is that the media is basing it on 1. Nothing save furthering the myth that Antifa doesnt exist.
2. "Well, we asked them and they said they werent Antifa so...."

Give me a damn break. They could be lighting the fires with Antifa flags while reciting the Communist manifesto and the media would tell us they were Proud Boys.

I also question this fire fighter pull out. They were ordered to retreat. I would live to talk to a firefighter directly to see how they felt about the withdrawal. Kate brown said at least 5 times this morning that the first responders only mission right now is to save lives... you have to let it burn to get your point across.. see, climate change wiped out Oregon..

@Patriot Coalition , thank you and the significant other (don‚Äôt know his handle) for the company and backup this evening. Happily is was another patriot we hunted down.

PSA for all the hunters, make sure you vet those that you come in contact with, but do so in a responsible and respectful manner. I had 2 contacts today at GP and they were on our side. Stay safe and treat others with respect.

@JW Central Oregon , thank you for keeping me informed and being on the line to take information from my stops.

Stay safe üá∫üá∏, my fellow Patriot hunters.

Avatar
Patriot Coalition
We only go off of what our intel confirms- sorry
Ok- bear with me- a lot of new people- so here comes the copy and paste of the ‚ÄúRules/Guidelines‚Äù
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
There are a few things that I believe need to be addressed. So please bare with me.
** There is a lot of new people joining our group. Everyone needs to be aware that each person we add have been through a vetting process, a process that hasn‚Äôt let us down yet. We have very dedicated mods who take this task very seriously and who are absolutely amazing! So please give a shout out to our mods and thank them - they keep us safe.
** Belonging to this group there is certain expectations we have for each and everyone of you.
1st- our group name and members stay out of any conversations with people or groups. Other groups do not vet like we do and have had people get into their groups because of this. So PLEASE do not talk about what we talk about or what we are planning with ANY other group. Our leaders do communicate with other group leaders and we do work with them.
2nd- If we find out that information is being leaked out to others or other groups
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY WARNING. You will be removed from our group immediately.
3rd-Do NOT share information as to rallys or needing people to show here or there. This causes chaos amongst everyone and makes our phones light up like a Christmas tree. If there is any sort of intel or information you have please message one of us personally- we will then give it to our intel team to dig into and verify.
4th- We believe that anyone who wants to be a patriot can be- from being a prayer warrior to bring boots on the ground- we do not turn anyone away, unless they can not be vetted of course.
5th- Just because you invited people to the group does not mean they get an automatic pass- so please do not send us a message stating you invited so n so and you vouch for them. If you think about it, how many of you would know me from Adam on the street? How many know if I‚Äôm male or female? Do you see where I am going here?
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è I have met a lot of you, but you haven‚Äôt even realized it.
6th- Here is our heads/leads- and if they say something you can bet it has been ran past all of us and they need to be respected. Trent aka Spartan, Dan aka Bravo91, Chris Tough, Joe W, John aka JH, Pat aka John Elway.
7th- Do not post your personal address or phone numbers- PM the person you are wanting to give this information to.
8th- When we are called out as a group- PLEASE PLEASE mask up- hide your identity.
9th- We will never stop you or say you can not go to any events or rally‚Äôs/flag waves, we are not her to dictate, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we will not worry about you. We also will never say you can not be part of other groups as well... but we ARE saying that what is said in here is NOT to be told to other groups.
‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
11th- Please do not post stating that you could use some help at events or up coming events to the entire group- please pass that along to us- we may have something in the works and getting ready to release it to the group.
12th- We do have fun- we do joke around and we do chatter a lot. What we are doing is important- we do wish we could go to each and every event, but sometimes our prescience makes things worse. We are not a group that wants to stir the pot or cause trouble but we are a group that will go in to help stop an issue before it starts.
Ok- now back to what you were doing. Lmao

Ok- so yes there is some issues in Springfield- politics should NOT be brought into an evacuation area and some have... people are on edge because there has been ‚Äúshots fired‚Äù but not at the evac site... we have some of our people there keeping things calm... I am heading down there as well so we have a lead there...

If you chose to go there as well- rule is- you check in with me- do NOT kit up- do NOT open carry and DO NOT let our political views get in the way of what the volunteers are doing - no matter what side of the political side they are on- it is NOT the time or the place.

The whole damn state is in crisis right now. People are scared, tensions are high, and there's a lot of unknowns. Last thing we need is people fighting in the streets. Keep your heads.

Thank you to everyone that has mobilsed today and those who will do so as required in the future to assure the safety of our respective communities.

A special thank you to the members of leadership who have been actively engaged in not only the days activities but the narratives that will engage our activities as well.

It is imperative that we STAY THE COURSE and continue living out the Coalition message, that being selfless service of our Faith , Family, Community and Country

Regardless of how our fellow American identifies we will support and defend them despite personal cost unless they , by their own choice, position themselves our enemies.

Then we crush them.

Otherwise, we must and shall work with them for the benefit of those who may be suffering. Community first, we can argue later.

I don't post much here. These reports haven't been vetted by the coalition intel team. Here's my oregon city local intel.

Mulino golf course posted on facebook that they caught people trying to light maltovs on the course last night some time.

According to clackamas scanners and a fellow patriot of mine, active looters in estacada and molalla.

The same patriot has a friend who's dad killed two terrorist setting a fire on his land in redland. Cops arrived and took the bodies.

The same patriot informed me that his police app is showing ccom labeling calls as terrorism. (Screenshot attached)

A family in Mulino was told by police to kill anyone trying to set fires.

It's 9/11 folks. Some of us don't fucking forget and will never forgive.

OK IM GOING TO PIT THIS OUT..

At Springfield High where everyone is out- the REASON why nothing Patriotic is to be worn is because politician stance needs to be left at the street. There is BLM and BU and possibly Antifa evacuates there and or helping. The guy running it is a Patriot and he doesn‚Äôt like them there either, BUT it is a safe zone for EVERYONE. There has been 3 ‚ÄúPatriot‚Äù groups down there raising hell and causing issues. I know exactly who they are and it‚Äôs typical. They have been there since the beginning yelling and cussing out people and it has A LOT of people on edge who just want a safe place not a war zone. I went down last night and told him that if they need us there and to be professional and not stir the pot and to run security to call me. Even though he is a Patriot himself he had to really get after them to shut them up.

1) NO STARTING SHIT WITH BLM, BU, ETC. We all need to work together to help out fellow Oregonians. If I catch wind of anyone in the Coalition harrassing/starting shit you will be removed from this Coalition. Period. No ifs, ands or buts. Picking fights and being confrontational gives us a bad rap
I repeat: IF ANY LEADS HEAR OF MEMBERS STARTING SHIT YOU ARE REMOVED AND NO LONGER WITH THIS COALITION. If you are threatened and have to defend yourself, that's fine. Don't start anything, but defend if attacked

2) help any groups with evac/donations if you can.
3) lets fact check our info before posting it. Too much false info is flying around right now. Example: we had patriots being followed by other patriots thinking they're Ants looking for trouble. Lack of communication and bad intel was a major factor in this
4) if you're out and about helping, don't be in full kit. Keep it close, but people are already freaked out. Seeing a group rolling up in full battle rattle doesn't ease tension
5) STAY SAFE DAMNIT
Ok. Rant over

I dont agree with any of those suggestions however I am not one to advise on the handling of any situation. I have learned over the years that you can plan to do things all you want but when its go time your reaction determines the outcome. Under these conditions arson is considered attempted mass murder in my eye.

One of our guys was saying a firefighter was talking to OSP and the trooper mentioned that they believe that there is some coordinated arson, and they believe that the next fire might start off 22, south salem, or west salem.
There's an ass load of trees next to Enchanted forest, and salem hills to the south. Perfect place to start another fire, and Parrish Gap is a good access point

While I understand and agree with the statute that has been going around concerning acceptable handling of suspected arsonists up to and including lethal force please remember that in alll situations where force must be applied , this isnt the movies, you WILL be arrested and the onus of proof and evidence will be upon you.

When confronted with any situatiom act in accordance with your own judgement but remember the repercussions that come after the moment of action.

And please, as there has been considerable levels of misplaced suspicion bordering upon harassment and aggression fuelled by heightened tensions and shot through nerves , it is of paramount importance to remember that every goth kid you see with a lighter isnt necessarily an arsonist, it is entirely possible they really are just lighting a cigarette.

I would be careful about sharing and taking seriously posts such as the ones above. Antifa are misguided, they are wrong, but , as they have proven , they are faaar from stupid , therefore anything that you see that amounts to admittance of their malevolence are wholly false.

Remember their M.O. is denial and their official stance is that there is no such thing as Antifa.

Be smart with what we are sharing as we cannot afford errors of judgement as patriots get needlessly riled up over social media troll posts.

On a day that many of us planned to rally at the Capitol in memory of those citizens, soldiers and first responders who lost their lives , Patriots across the Pacific Northwest are living our ideals in real time, offering their time, equipment, money , resources and labor to assist their communities impacted by the unprecedent wild fires ravaging the land.

They do this knowing not the politics, religion, culture, creed , race or otherwise of those whose property they protect in full kit from looters, whose families they evacuate and shelter, whose children they console and feed,or whose livestock they wrangle and move. Today they know only that they are their neighbors.

Today they know they are Americans, and that is enough.

Perhaps tomorrow we will argue again. Maybe tomorrow we will be divided. Maybe this experiment we call America will fail and it will all fade away..

I drove Hwy 36 today, in through Eugene and out to check out the Springfield donation site at my alma mater;)
Stopped by Alderwood Park and drove through as we have been having anarchy symbols painted on the log and trees and bathrooms.

All was quiet.
Driving into Springfield was like entering the apocalypse. Just surreal.

I saw lots of non-evacuated looking people there grabbing suitcases and filling them up with donations and steady streams of cars entering from all directions.

I did see a huge red, white & blue sign that said Patriot Rescue‚Äù. It was an animal rescue and the ladies at the booth seemed to be coordinating rescues of animals in evacuated areas.
I also saw a few people walking around with Patriotic masks on as well.

I didn‚Äôt want to get in the way, so I stayed at a distance and watched.
Such a show of pure American grit. ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏

Just got in from scouting Wilsonville and surrounding areas.

Putting focus here not only because it is local , but because it is flanked by the river on one side and bisected by I-5 on the other.

Conventional knowledge dictates that a fire from the east or west that touches dowm here is not natural, and therefore presents itself as a logical inroad for man made mayhem
That being said. All quiet in Wilsonville and surroundings

@Debbie ive been out a few times but havent seen anyone. Im thinking they were either dropping stuff off by the fields or the ind. park behind home depot. OR could they be coming back from last nights riots...not the umbrella.....possibly ditch their bikes in the bushes somewhere and hitch a ride into town. We saw them stopped at the little parking spot by the bridge and started riding west on grand prairie over the bridge. We zipped past n waited for them to pass the churches. The one kept on going up Grand Prairie the other three crossed the road when we started coming again, took the time to stop n flip us off and then we went around and caught them coming up waverly towards 21st and by the time we could turn around they were gone. Sent a friend down the bike paths, nothing. Covered the streets pretty good for an hour or so no luck.

Patriots: When you are patrolling keep an eye out for flammables near the road that may or may not have been placed there intentionally. I have been notified from a trusted source there have been furniture, objects, and whatnots "found" a long side or in the middle of the road. Tomorrow we will scout and REMOVE such objects placed intentionally or unintentional in order to prevent more fires.

It is apparent that with numerous posts, and suspicious activity, they are possibly using the "cry wolf" tactic. When you flood the area with bogus reports, then the guys doing the real shit , can sneak by undetected to perform their criminal activity. Its a collective effort and will exhaust all of those that are chasing the wrong perp

Was driving.
Small parking lot. Lots of cars right then.
One black small sedan. One dark blue.
The other I cdidnt catch the color. Was parked in the dark and was the first one out very quickly. Rice burner sound tho.
It blinded me as I was trying to see the drivers face in the black sedan.
No mask. Best description I can give is kinda sorta looked like Luis Marquez (NOT HIM) on crack but looked like he was probably a bit taller.

I just had a couple ideas. @Patriot Coalition , that if we get flagging tape. I‚Äôll say orange, that you put a small loop on the CB antenna, radio antenna, drivers side mirror. Most of us don‚Äôt know who the other is, but if it‚Äôs between us, on how we identify rigs then that will surely cut down on false chases. They could be a good guy, we know that, but if it‚Äôs kept to only this group, we could I‚Äôd each other without running a big target flag. Just look for orange flagging tape on antennas, mirrors. Thoughts Moma Bear?
We did similar back in the Virginia march on the capital. Tied around left bicep. Different colors of flagging to show which company you were in.

Flagging tape is pretty cheep. We gab all share where we meet someone. Maybe start off with 2 colors and moms Bear calls a color in the am. Not need to change everyday, but the option is there. Does away with friendly fire in group, and less stress on confrontation if someone isn‚Äôt flying colors.

So since this is my idea, I‚Äôll take charge for now.

Get 2 rolls of flagging tape. Our fight with each other would be Beavers, or ducks. We all know that orange for beavers is #1. And who doesn‚Äôt like the look, taste, or smell of a beaver. They make damn good chilli üòÇ

Then we have green for ducks. They are fun to hunt with a shotgun. Make perty good jerky. Or, if you find a woman that leans that way.......well let‚Äôs just say my ex was a duck. So fuck a duck.

If you are offended, take it up with Bob at your local Walmart.

2 official colors. Orange and green. Will take a few days for everyone to catch up I‚Äôm sure. So start with orange. Just a small loop around the FB, ham, radio antenna. Share colors with those in the group as a foot will go a long way. Do not trail the color for a foot. Tie a small piece that‚Äôs visible. Then we can id the other. I‚Äôm open to idea but share, and 2 colors for now.

Sheriff Yon Announces Several Suspicious Fires in Lebanon and Sweet Home Areas

Linn County Sheriff's Office
Monday, September 14th, 2020 ‚Ä¢ 9:22 AM
Sheriff Jim Yon reports his deputies are investigating several suspicious fires that began early this morning at 2:41 a.m. Deputies and fire personnel responded to eight different small fires in the areas of Scott Mountain Road west of Sweet Home, Whiskey Butte Drive east of Sweet Home and Washburn Heights Drive outside of Brownsville. All the fires occurred within a two-hour period.

A pick-up described as a small, white or silver, 1990s Nissan Hardbody with a black canopy was seen in the area of one of the fires. This is a vehicle of interest and we are actively looking for it.

These fires are still under investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to call 541-812-2260.

It's thing multiple things together that have come to light.
One of the fire bugs, and his friend who owns the black truck. All incidents happens in the same general location.
And they are see in the same type of fire fighting gear in multiple places.
Along with equipment (chainsaw) needed to cause damage in the same area.
It's tying****
Then they also show up together on social media.
And you get clear pics of both their faces together in and out of their supposed wildland fire fighting gear.
I've been following several of these things. And this pic makes a LOT of sense to me.

This is one of the hardest posts I am writing..... but here it goes...

I have decided to step down and out of PC of PNW. This decision did not come easy but one that needed to be made. I will be handing the lead position over to Trent aka Spartan.

Trent and Dan aka Bravo91 will also become the admins of the FB page and take control over of that as well.

The Venmo account I will be forwarding onto them as well. As far as the Go Fund Me, I will see if I can return the funds to those who contributed, if I am unable to I will then have it withdrawn and also send that to them.

I adore all of you and it has been such an honor to meet you all. Stay safe, watch each other‚Äôs 6 and keep fighting the good fight.

Stepping down vs complete removal proves there was a disagreement to the direction of this group. I haven't been around long enough to know of a direction issue, but there apparently was one.
So now the new leadership should be completely clear on what this organization will be, going forward ..then stay on that path. That way, if we decide to stay, we all will be in agreement of how we want this to go.
I, too almost left...any time there is a shift in leadership the organization is vulnerable. I will tell you, that last rally at the capital had me heading for the door.

My opinion. I want to be a part of a group that leads by positive example. The leaders need a clear and concise vision for the coalition and how we want to be perceived with the general public. We can accomplish peace through superior firepower but in order to do that we need discipline. We need cohesion. We need to all be on the exact same sheet of music or this orchestra will sound horrible.

I'll flat out be honest. I messaged the leads, saying I was disappointed in how patriots had been acting the past week with the fires. I felt that it seemed many were running around "chasing ghosts" and not helping the communities with the crisis going on. I let my emotions get the better of me, since my group in Southern Oregon had been busting ass helping where we could and I worded it in a harsh way. Which was my mistake. I understand what our patriots were doing, and appreciate it. But we were getting a lot of bad press (which we always do no matter what) and I flat out didn't like seeing the bad press
So it was my mouth/thumbs that caused this strife. Simple as that. For that I apologize. I don't want to see us fall apart because of my input.
I was just overwhelmed with all of the chatter of patrols, hunting arsonists, etc.

I trust Trent and Dan wholeheartedly! They are very disciplined and informed, make informed decisions with consideration for those involved. I believe they will take this group in a very worthwhile direction. It takes the right people in the group as well. We need to be respectfully honest, disciplined, with egos in check, trust and respect for leadership. Common goals, with trusted members who do their part and an agreement from all to stay in bounds of the group mission. I think there are positive changes coming, so hold tight everyone! It's been tough to read the same repeated warnings regarding mission chatter, etc to adults. No one should need a babysitter. For many it's our future, our lives, our jobs, and possibility of not only prosecution of a member but every leader on the line. Above all, we need to consider everyone in the group with every action taken, every message written. BLM is fueled by inappropriate emotions, we have to be better than them, or it's all pointless.

In the end, everyone is their own person and can make their own decisions. That's your God given right.
It comes down to this (which was the same rules as the portland op on the 22nd):
We all are working together, and want to back each other. But if you are going to do your own thing and charge into the fray, and it puts the rest of the Coalition at risk to bail you out, you're one your own. We said it again and again on the 22nd. If we can help in any way we will.
I'm not wanting to see people leave, nor will I boot anyone out over this. I want all of us to work together. Defend each other. Once we start bickering and arguing amongst ourselves the battle is lost

I put this to all the leads. We form separate arms inside the same organization. A Community Service and Community Defense. Any member can take part in either arm. It seems to me that both are going to be needed going forward. Neither are wrong nor are they more important than the other. Each must be in play equally otherwise we those this fight.

A Regional lead to coordinate each Arm in each region. We can show a collected organized well put together team to help in whatever our communities need.
Rules of actions can then be put out for each mission. We can be gummby and transfer our numbers to whichever is needed more at any moment. We would be strong and flexible.
God bless. And remember the the 26th is looming and they gather their strength and educate while we are fighting and struggling.

This is Shelb...we were evacuated from our home. We live near Salem. We are also both veterans who served in Iraq, patriotic, and know how to handle weapons. We have been helping out at the fairgrounds as well as taking care of our own animals. At night we would go out to our area, knowing homes were vacated and patrol for looters and anyone who should not appear out in that area. As well as check on anyone else who happened to stay back. We were not being irresponsible or chasing ghosts. We also have no intent of giving the group a bad name, and have actually not mentioned belonging to this group to anyone. So what exactly is a patriot? What does a normal everyday person think when they hear the term patriot? This is what needs to be thought of when out and about. We want people on our side not against us or looking at us as troublemakers. I have often felt we are alone in this area as we don't get much in the way of responses. We want to know others are there if needed.

@D i agree with you on that. Us that are leads in s oregon have no clue what all goes on in the northern counties and it isn't right for us to be giving out directions for up there. And vice versa. Personally I think we need regional leads, and a separate chat thread for that. That way if there is a need for a call out, it goes to the regional leads and they can discuss what all is needed for that, whether it be a full call out, or just that region.

Until recently I was lane county chapter commander of the Combat Veterans Association. I left because most leaders didn‚Äôt have the balls to stand up for what‚Äôs right and very few members actually participated. What I did like about it was the structure of the organization. There were region reps, state reps and chapter commanders. Every chapter had a chapter executive board that heard items brought up by members and everything was voted on. I understand we don‚Äôt have the numbers for a complex structure but a chain of command helps keeps things in order without chaos.

I just received this from a number I don‚Äôt know. I can tell all here as a combat veteran that I had no interest in this group until the fires and personally told someone from here to stay the fuck away from Portland and Eugene. Those are not areas I‚Äôm familiar with, and it is stupid to travel to an unknown area with little to no intel. That folks, is how soldiers and warriors get killed. I know from experience.

The people who were out In linn county were working In Their area. Trent and dan have no fucking idea what they are talking about.

But the power hungry brothers can‚Äôt take suggestions because they know it all and they will lead you all in Portland to get run off by Antifa again. Yes I‚Äôm saying it. The last mission to Portland was a FAIL along with many other missions that failed. To Trent and dan. Good luck. I hope you don‚Äôt get people from the coalition killed because of your ignorance and little man syndrome.

When quoting a text, using quotation marks helps with confusion
The tape was a good idea, but other groups, an unaffiliated people wouldn't have any clue. Running around hell and back chasing every "tip" seemed like a bad idea to me. There were many people who were on our side being fingered as antifa pyros. With emotions running high, the likelihood of people taking friendly fire was high. I also don't think Dan was only talking about this group making bad press, but militias in general making us all look like idiots by making "checkpoints".

@Sam O I did not use tips or information from here while I was out in East Linn-Co. I simply put out where I was on here so that a few, that I personally know from here, in the area, would know MY situation. While out, I was personally Thanked by a OSP possum cop( game warden ü§™) and 2 LCSO. If that was too much for this group then so be it. But I‚Äôm not here to cause trouble nor get anyone hurt.

I love lamp! Listen guys, I know everything is hot right now, but let's not let this ruin divide another great patriot group which will allow Antifa to win. I believe you guys can work this out 1776 2.0 guys are always here to support you guys and can help plan or develop ideas along with you. I can even invite you guys to one of our training events/range days and can get everyone talking around a fun day of training. I will provide the beers and range. STAY STRONG, relax. Check egos as the door and work together to beat these fucks.

One of the check points in our area was probably one of the more serious ones.
The cop thanked everyone for being out and helping and advised them about stopping anyone in the road way and some of the legal issues they could face.
He advised them to strategically park several vehicles in such a way that anyone coming thru would have to do so very slowly and be very obvious about taking their pictures of both vehicles and faces. And let them know that barrels down at the low ready position is not "brandishing a weapon"

Currently on the road , but it appears to me that the issue surrounding recent events is more the execution and less the intent.

Therefore I propose leadership get together and codify a code of conduct/ rules of engagement that must be adhered to when acting under the auspices or in representation of the Coalition .

That being said , we are all free Americans and free to act as we believe fit, but it must and should be understood that to act outside of the parameters of conduct is to relinquish access to Coalition resources during said action / event unless expressly cleared by respective leadership.

We must maintain continuity and expectation of action in the field .

ÔøºI agree on the regions and the need for regional leaders. It‚Äôs not always possible for Trent and Dan to get to Eugene or Salem fast enough to help if something goes bad. As far as I know we have a lot of trained combat veterans in the group that would make great regional leaders. We need to split up duties for different zones. Each leader would have a group of guys and gals under them in that zone. If we need help in that area we call the the closest leader and his/her people and in the next zone.

The great differentiator between us and the opponents of our liberty are our ideals, and these ideals must be realised through equally lofty actions and behaviours worthy of our beliefs and cause.

In a world where the media is openly hostile and everything is a capture device the way we hold and conduct ourselves will be imperative moving forward.

And our conduct and execution must be so that our fellow Americans whom we offer our time and hold out our hand in service to are not only grateful and welcoming to it, but are moved to offer themselves and do it too.

@Sam O If someone is going to be carrying a weapon then they need to be level headed, and use wisdom when confronted with a situation. If they are one to panic, and immediately start shooting,, at their own "perceived" idea of a threat, they shouldn't be carrying. No one should be doing any shooting unless their life is in danger or someone elses. Patrolling ones own area, along with other known patriots, using some form of challenge/pw or glo sticks etc...is a good idea to keep folks aware and know who all is in the area helping. Having some form of radio communication would be nice.
Also, at the last event we attended in Portland. 3 of us were left behind. We watched as Antifa passed on by us, except for some that stayed behind to heckle us. This required keeping a cool head so we could safely get back to our vehicle. We walked on by other Antifa. So to keep everyone safe, there needs to be better commo, teamwork /support, accountability, equipment for all, and training.
We were evacuated because the fire was within 6-10 miles

üíôüíôüíôüíô is it possible to have an in person gathering before the 26th so we can get aligned. I really really want to be a part of this. Im a pissed off American who loves our country deeply. Some of us have zero training but huge hearts! There are many positions to hold and grow with in our group. We have an amazing grit to get er done, i just feel the need for a connect to smooth our edges. Our opponents have had years to form their alignment and that gives them an advantage (per say). Our hearts and determination is what puts us in front lets keep it that way. Some of us have spent lots of $$ to prepare for the next event and we still need help from leadership to ensure we are properly protected, armed and placed. I know we have the whole fire thing going on but...Is it possible for someone between VC and Medford to host? We would but our house is a bit small. I'll bring food!

I need input on sizes for plates.
What is the most common and useful size.
So far it looks like 10X12 but 1 person has asked me for an 11X12
The coating adds to dinesion. So a 10 wide actually comes out to about 10 1/4 inches
I have to do all the coatings at once for money reasons.
These plates should effectively be a level 4 but Trent will be testing them when they are finish so that is YTBD.

Hey, for those ordering anything offline, DO NOT USE FEDEX. if you have to, buy the FedEx express shipping, it's a different company.
I had 2 separate orders that possibly got sent on the same truck and both are "pending". FedEx said I may have to file a lost package form.
Ar500 guy told me if it comes to that, file a police report, because there's no way they both "got lost"

So i ordered off of Botachs. Website and got two sets of soft plates rated 3a and two vism carriers for $100 a set. Please take not it took 11 days for them to ship but i did get the items quickly once they did ship. Probly too late for the event on the 26th but for the future or if someone is looming for a cheap keep in ur car or close in the house set this is for u

If you order from down range industry you will have the. By the 26th

So it was 220 with shipping for 2 sets. If you read botachs reviews prepare to be mortified. I can say i was not happy with waiting 11 days for the item to ship.
And these are not hard plates they are soft and only pistol rated and stab proof. The carrier is cheep but the entire set is super lite and covers the important parts. Could easely be worn under a jacket and no one would know

What we are doing is not random. Patriots around the country are currently organizing and preparing.

We know D day is coming after November. We know that what we are seeing now is a betrayal of trust of the people by our government. We know that this war has a long time to go. We are not alone. There are people all around us supporting us. There are people all around that would stand side by side with us.

Though times are stressful, we have to dig deep and keep pushing forward.

Regions, or counties are good for knowing your closest members, and getting to know them individually on a more frequent basis than the entire group. But as far as only having them? OPM wouldn't let individual counties even talk amongst themselves, much less meet with each other. Nobody communicated with anyone, nobody knew what was happening. It made for an extremely weak group.

I may be down that way Sunday to drop off donations for a family who lost everything in the fire. It depends on if they have a place at that time to accept them because of how much I collected would be a bit overwhelming (which is a good thing!) if they were still couch surfing.
Would love to come if that‚Äôs ok just to meet folks face to face.
Does anyone know of donation drop-off points in Northern Oregon? Not all of what I collected will be need by just this family.

I have some news that may upset some of our members. Please read this entire text and please carefully contemplate your response. 
First, fellow Patriots, all of you are what makes this group amazing and possible! Working together with trust and integrity is crucial to our mission, our success, safety and survival. Irrefutable information and several recent events necessitated an immediate review and a vote by several leads and longtime members, to remove Robin from this group permanently. 
We all realize and appreciate Robin's efforts to start this group and help us grow and yes, this sucks. This was not an easy decision! Please trust that it was a necessary one, made to protect the best interest of our members and our group as a whole.  
We have a mission that we are all still committed to! We need each one of you to act with integrity and respect.  
We are not going to air all the details, or create drama and we are asking that you will also refrain from that conduct, as well. 
This will be difficult for Robin, and our members, keep in mind that it is required that once a member is removed, they cannot be privy to member info, intel, plans, etc. and obviously, violating those rules or a lack of integrity and respect would be grounds for removal. Drama will not be tolerated. 

To be clear, no one in this group has been compromised and our priority is to keep it that way!  

With that said, we are moving forward, hopefully all, together. 

You will be invited to a new FB group within the next few days. Each member will be vetted. Be patient. Any delays with FB will not affect our mission.

Patriots, keep your chin up and remember the reasons you are here!  

We will still be meeting up. It looks like Sunday at 3pm. Location should be finalized by tomorrow night. 

We have a lot to discuss and yes, leads will be established,  etc. 

In the meantime, we have a team that will be working hard vetting all intel and preparing info for release at that meeting. 
Everything we know will be shared then, so we can each make our own informed decisions.  

We are excited to move forward, together!  

We will have a name change. A mission statement and rules of conduct will be available soon for review. 

We have some amazing sponsors and donors who wish to support us once we are re-established. 

We will also fundraise for additional legal, issue gear, group needs, member needs, etc. 

There will be training events coming soon. 

Can't wait to share some exciting things we've been working on! 

Thank you all for reading this far. So grateful for each one of you and proud to be a part of this group!

Sorry about earlier
So I am committed to say In with my brothers / sisters I want to keep us moving forward with the great things with our group
So quick run down
1-We are keeping same leads
2-We are going to have a central command
3-we are going to have regional leaders ( when we lay regions out who wants to apply ?)
We are going to monthly meetings somehow in person or Skype
4- we are going to have a chain of command in place to work with regional leaders
5- this patriotic group will be number 1 because we are going to work as a team / unit
So I just wanted to give you a quick run down we will go over more in the meet and greet
Thank you everyone

It's been a rough week and half with fires everywhere, patriots helping our neighbors, patrolling the country side and then throw in the last 72 hrsü§™üôà Thank-you to Shelley for sharing with care and compassion a very difficult decision that was made. Thanks for those who've stayed, will stay and praying for those who left. We're all human, we make mistakes and we're a little emotional with our cities burning because of the Democrats and our forest on fire because of whatever. Grateful our current leaders and those with experience of dealing with adversity will lead the way. We have a mission and I stayed because I believe in its people to complete that mission.

Damn. Lol. I still prefer this group over our last. I'm glad our small group can be a part of a bigger whole, and we're excited to meet with you guys. It has definitely been a stressful week, and I hope the best for Red with whatever happened, and wherever she goes from here.
I have avoided joining a militia for over 10 years, due to the shear unknown of it all, and back then they weren't all over Facebook, and I remember there was only around 2-3 big ones and they were in the distant corners of the state. I can definitely say that I feel a lot better knowing that I am not alone in my endeavor to secure myself and my family. Thanks.

This is also happening the 26th....Godly coincidence

Has America moved so far from God, it's passed the point of no return? Religious believers gathering on the National Mall and around the nation September 26th are pleading with God that it not be so. At two huge events ‚Äì Washington Prayer March 2020 and a solemn assembly called The Return ‚Äì they'll be praying America be given more time.
 
Evangelist Franklin Graham and prophetic writer Jonathan Cahn both say God led them separately to call for these huge assemblies on the National Mall September 26th.

The passing of Ginsburg will lead to a maelstrom of chaos in the streets.

This means Trump gets ANOTHER supreme court appointment. Ginsburg was the great bulwark that has stopped the overturning of Roe V Wade for decades.

Another conservative appointment will tip the scales and the left is going to go BERSERK

Rep. Tom Emmer went on to tell Spicer, "People should understand that Oregon's 4th district, Donald Trump only lost this district by a few hundred votes, less than 500 votes in 2016.

We must not give these people who are threatening the very fabric of our society and its founding the grace of being called "liberals"

Those who would threaten violence in response to our rightful processes are dissidents, insurgents , seditionists , and , in the end, subversive Communists.

Lets call them, and respond to them, as what they are, they have no issue calling us names and labelling us this or that .

No more grace to the graceless. Call them what they are.

I download signal and sent a pm. I have used signal before. For those unaware of this app it has a feature that erases messages at a maximum of an hour time limit. If that feature cannot be disabled I believe can potentially hurt our communication with each other. If you dont constantly chech you're phone then that is lost information to you and people will have to constantly repeat messages. That feature is good for small groups but having over a hundred members I am not so sure. Just my opinion.

There is an option to not have a chat erase. There is a risk to keeping communications. I would like to see people think before they text, but sometimes that doesn't happen. For example, Writing a text about beating an ant, even in jest, then there's an encounter, that even though defensive, that text will be used to paint a different picture by a DA. It's risky at best. That app also can be set to not allow screenshots, which further protects. Look up the articles on Patriot Front. 6 months of screenshots of actual hateful messages were shared with world...

Nobody should be talking about violence against anyone. There's too much risk involved, and can be incriminating in itself even if you don't do anything. Better to be safe.

Everyone please install the telegram app. Then go to your settings and remove your full name, set a username if you didn't do that originally. Go to settings(upper left 3 bars) privacy and set options to your desired level.
Set a time limit for your messages to be deleted. Bare in mind, that will occur from the time you post, regardless who has seen it or not. Choices are nobody or contacts for each thing in list.
There's a setting to not allow your texts to be forwarded, I highly suggest that is utilized.
Please bear in mind, with any chat app the media shared such as photos, can be saved to the individual phone. A time limit will be set to delete past texts for the entire group chat as well.
The invite to groups will be sent shortly.

Ted posted online tonight asking everyone to dim their lights to prevent light pollution, it's not healthy and it's time for migrating birds. No fucking joke. The comments are priceless! Been laughing for half hour. "Yeah sure Ted, we will just burn a fucking mattress in the street if it's too dark, you're fucking stupid!".

Tonight, Portlanders are encouraged to dim or turn off their lights for "Lights Out Portland." Light pollution can be harmful to humans, plants and other animals including the birds who are beginning their migration. Thanks @PortlandAudubon for your advocacy and leadership.

Per leads, families are welcome with understanding that any intel, plans, past actions cannot be discussed in their presence for obvious reasons. They will need to commit to follow and respect the same rules we do, protecting anonymity of group! Please consider the safety of our members when deciding who to bring.

We can break away. This is a large area we will be in. We can figure this out as everyone gets there. It is a Sunday, family time is most important to all of us. We can make this work.

In the interest of the long view, though we wont get into it here, with the rising temperature of the political climate we really should be sure we are watching the current news cyes closely, as coincidentally our street level opposition never seems to fail to act upon the going narrative.

Also , we need not forget our events at hand, but we must be sure we are looking toward November and the week of the elections.

I suspect an unprecedented leftist mobilisation , and that is simply based on the most recent news cycles, and it only goes up from here.

For any upcoming political heat, I recommend finding your nearest patriot, and making a plan with them. My family and friends will head to my house, because it's far enough out of town, it's a hill, and it's defensible against city idiots.
