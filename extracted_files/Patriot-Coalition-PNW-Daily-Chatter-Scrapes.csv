,Avatar,Rex Thank you 
,Steve Abbott,Thank you Steve Abbott changed name to Steve 
,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Evening everyone-  Things are getting back to normal üôè  With that being said - here is our board of leaders- they make the decisions together as to if this group gets a call out and will post in the Go Team group... they are the only ones to post in there- once they post- questions and details can be asked...  As far as intel goes- we need a new group of people to step forward and help validate possible issues and report their findings to the board.. please do NOT post possible issues in here- please direct message one of the following  Trent Dan Him Who (Chris Tough) John H Joseph Pat Or Myself  If I have forgotten anyone I will place in another message ... 
,Steve,10/4 
,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Once you have sent something to one of them- they will follow up on it and have intel working on it as well.. we will not be getting called out for ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù. People have the 1A and as long as they are peaceful our presence is not needed there- no need to take time away from our families or work.  We need people to be active - we can‚Äôt stop Antifa destroying our state if we refuse to stand up...  We also need you to please reach out to your friends and family and invite them to join the FB group page. From there they will get vetted and added. As for meetings- we will discuss that further down the line and hope to make them in different places so everyone has a chance to get to one with driving hours each time.  We are starting fresh - regrouping - and going back to the way it was intended for- an action group.  If you chose not to be in this group please let us know and we will remove you from the group so that your phone doesn‚Äôt keep getting blown up  Thank you everyone who has remained. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 
,Mark Melchi,"OK We are not patriot prayer btw, but we had our event today and got shot at by Antifa in Portland just FYI. Redirect Notice google.com "
2020-08-15 20:24:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,I actually watched the video of the person shooting- from several different angles and it actually looked like one of the younger ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù kids as he left the parking garage. üòûüòû I will trying to copy the link and bring it over 
2020-08-15 20:24:00,Dan-Medford,I saw that today mark.im sorry we weren't there

2020-08-15 20:52:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,But in his defense - they were told not to follow them or come near them- and guess-and what they did- they should have let them leave peacefully 
2020-08-15 20:52:00,Mark Melchi,"We were leaving and they actually shot inside the garage up to the 2nd level. But Antifa will also send the fake female reporters to ask patriots about their guns, and they have blank or live rds for those types and will claim shots, and take pictures of the casings saying patriots shot at them. Patriot Coalition Of Oregon removed Foghorn from the group. "
2020-08-15 20:52:00,John Hufford,I'm asking a question and don't mean any disrespect. Are there more than a handful of Portland residents that are willing to do what's necessary to take their city back from these terrorists? 
2020-08-15 21:35:00,Dan-Medford,I think there are. Trent has been talking to a group up there. Hed know more than I 
2020-08-15 21:35:00,Mark Melchi,"@John Hufford Not really, we get more FU at our events. Most of Portland is scared, or don't want to get targeted by BLM if they don't support their movement. Also, most down town residents are very successful people who can afford the real estate, and really just don't want to be bothered and don't care. "
2020-08-15 21:35:00,John Hufford,"If they don't care enough to do anything about it, why should we? "
2020-08-15 21:35:00,Dan-Medford,"@John Hufford in my opinion, if nothing is done then the enemy has a stronghold. Look at the CHOP zone. Since it was allowed to happen and accepted, everyone who wants to ""make themselves heard"" (besides patriots) now thinks that's ok. If we give up on Portland, it's just a stronghold that will just keep getting worse and worse. But that's just my personal thoughts "
2020-08-15 21:35:00,John Hufford,"I respect your opinion. But if residents don't care enough to defend their own neighborhoods, why should we risk our lives and livelihoods? Worse yet, they turn on us helping them? "
2020-08-15 21:58:00,Dan-Medford,"It's my country, my state. As much as I hate portland, it's still part of the USA and i will not stand for a communist/terrorist regime terrorizing it. I should have been up there sooner. I feel like absolute dog shit for not being up there today. I let fellow patriots down, but thank god no one was seriously hurt. Not saying that I can change it, or that I'm billy badass, but that I'm willing to try to help. "
2020-08-15 22:04:00,Shelly A,"If they are ignored, then more rebellious thugs want to join up, seeing it as glorifying. They grow more, then they will continue growing and spreading outside Portland. "
2020-08-15 22:04:00,Steve,"I agree with you Dan, this country is under siege and there is an enemy encampment that is growing right here in our state. Im not looking for a fight but I pledged allegiance to our Flag and an oath to defend this country against exactly what is happening in Portland. I personally couldn't give a care about the city but if we don't take it back where will they hit next, and after that. Strategically our best move would be to meet them side by side along with our brothers and sisters in blue with hundreds not ten or twenty and drive them out. Stop their nightly occupation of Portland and send a strong message. My two cents.... "
2020-08-15 22:04:00,Shelly A,So who fired the shots? The kid in the blue car or a BLM Antifa? 
2020-08-15 22:04:00,John Hufford,Are law enforcement officers still being handcuffed? 
2020-08-15 22:04:00,Mark Melchi,"No we don't know yet, it was as we were leaving Yes still being cuffed. They still never even came to investigate. And it was a block away from their station lol "
2020-08-15 22:09:00,Dan-Medford,"I'm right there with ya brother man. We're gunna do it too. I think we're gonna try for next weekend. I know a group on Portland is wanting to link up, and theres plenty wanting to jump in. Yes, they still are. OSP pulled out after the da gave a list of what he wont prosecute. They said what's the point if they're just gunna let the anarchists go "
2020-08-15 22:09:00,John Hufford,If we do this. It can't be half-assed. We need to be more violent and aggressive than what we think is necessary. We cannot have a defensive mindset. We must take the attack to them. 
2020-08-15 22:09:00,Chris Tough,"Portland should be our main objective, personally I believe it should be our main focus and only objective at this time. Portland has become a safe haven for these scum. I think we should change that. We need numbers. People willing to fight, if We the people do not stand up we will lose ground so fast we will pay heavily trying to regain it. If we end the Portland problem we can step on the little flames that pop up afterwards. I‚Äôm in on taking Portland. We need numbers. At minimum a 100 patriots willing to fight "
2020-08-15 22:09:00,John Hufford,"I've heard there are organizations in other states who are like minded. If we could organize and coordinate a massive, nationwide offensive that takes place on the same day... "
2020-08-15 22:09:00,Steve,Lets see what kind of coalition we can put together. I'd like to see one to three hundred. I have friends ready to go. 
2020-08-15 22:26:00,Chris Tough,We need 100 at minimum. Those 100 would have to be willing to fight at all costs. There will be at least 300 if not more of them. We need a large number of patriots. I‚Äôm working on gathering numbers on my end. 
2020-08-15 22:26:00,Dan-Medford,"One thing everyone needs to realize and accept as well is that if something goes wrong, or even if something doesnt go wrong, the media is gunna spin this as we're the bad guys. I've accepted that. I'm sure most of you have as well. But anyone else we bring in has to understand that as well Btw, this just popped up. Bout time! https://trib.al/Fl36RIh "
2020-08-15 22:26:00,Trent -Medford,Sorry bin quite So Saturday will be a go i am getting us link up with the groups out there for a massive counter on these punks it‚Äôs going to be Saturday night I think we will have 100 plus and we are just going to plow the streets this will be aggressive I want everyone to be ready for this !

2020-08-15 22:26:00,Mark Melchi,"Agreed, like today in Portland they just labled my Group as Armed ""Patriot Prayer Members"" without asking who we actually were. Lol They will spin it no matter what "
2020-08-15 22:26:00,Chris Tough,I‚Äôm in for Saturday night I will have several others down to be there as well. Won‚Äôt be able to give a head count by tomorrow but before the end of the week I will have more guys on our 6

2020-08-16 21:10:00,Erik Neal,"What kind of defense's do we have? Shields, helmets, gas masks are a must. If every antifa puke has bear mase (which a lot of them do along with shields and riot gear) and we are ill prepared it's going to be a pretty shitty situation. "
2020-08-16 21:49:00,Doug Bulkeley,"I have a kevlar helmet, gas mask and baton for non lethal. Paige ‚ÄúPercy‚Äù has left the group. "
2020-08-16 21:49:00,Mark Melchi,"Our group gas been stabbed and shot over the months of protest in Portland...if you're planning going in, you need to expect war. In Portland you're dealing with the local gangs, baditos kids, Antifa, BLM, Redneck Rebellion group. You're non leathal better be a knife they usually have about 500-1500 rioters a night. So we need big numbers "
2020-08-16 21:49:00,Tony,Well said Mark. 
2020-08-16 21:49:00,John Hufford,Understood. Thank you. 
2020-08-16 21:49:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,I tried adding you but kept saying failed- so see if the links work- if they don‚Äôt- I may have to shut my phone off and reboot it 
2020-08-16 21:49:00,Trent -Medford,So let keep working on who‚Äôs coming think Saturday going to be a good turn out but is going to be a real rough one also 
2020-08-16 21:49:00,Chris Tough,I‚Äôd talk to Ragnar before committing to this Saturday He was up there last night. Has some good intel and a good plan. 
2020-08-16 21:49:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,I was so impressed at how he kept his cool- all of them actually 
2020-08-16 21:49:00,Trent -Medford,Whos Ragnar ? 
2020-08-16 21:59:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Agnar Chris has fat thumbs Lmao

2020-08-16 21:59:00,John Kramer,I was at the justice center yesterday and it was frosty tight . Please listen to the advise above . Come literally as prepared as you can . The numbers coming with us are huge from what I've heard . 
2020-08-16 21:59:00,Chris Tough,"We don‚Äôt have enough people to make this Saturday successful. Another week and we will be much better prepared. These people are all gas masked up, goggles, gloves and bear maze. We need to be just as well prepared. They are building shields, they are looking to get everyone head gear and goggles. I fully agree with his assessment and think it wise we take more time getting numbers and equipment Agnar‚Äôs building shields with his people. Kathy Hoaglin has joined the group "
2020-08-16 21:59:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,We are planning on networking during the day as well during the rally‚Äôs that are going on 
2020-08-16 21:59:00,John Kramer,"Chris Tough , I would like to talk with you if that's a possibility. Please go .lots of people going from up here . "
2020-08-16 21:59:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,@Chris Tough I think you will be surprised at how many people we brought in just today from other groups and networking- a couple of us have been going at it non stop all day I‚Äôm meeting up with a leader from another big group tomorrow evening- who is looking at bringing his group in as well 
2020-08-16 21:59:00,Trent -Medford,Chris I have bin working with Washington group also all day an other group to make Saturday a successful one I have bin on this all day 
2020-08-16 21:59:00,Chris Tough,"It would still be a good idea to talk to him and see what he has going on. I apologize I‚Äôm unable to help more, I‚Äôm up by mount hood working for the next two weeks. I will be there Saturday. Still talk to Agnar see what he has to say. "

2020-08-17 09:05:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Last night he was saying he was going to turn himself in but other rioters and Baloo King (streamer who was also there and didn‚Äôt stop it) told him not to and to go somewhere and lay low 
2020-08-17 09:05:00,Dan-Medford,Now there's this bullshit 
2020-08-17 09:05:00,Shelly A,People need to go on FB and complain about it as hate to try and get it removed 
2020-08-17 09:17:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Som Luna is planning a march this Saturday as well- shits going to be interesting- I was thinking about making small fliers to give to other patriots during the daytime Sunday asking them to stay and help- what do you think? We should also tell people to wear some sort of colored arm band so we know who each other is when shit gets crazy? Or do you have any other ideas on that? 
2020-08-17 09:17:00,Dan-Medford,"Flyers leave info for anyone to get their hands on. Some kind of identification is a good idea, as well as a verbal call and counter call (like in band of brothers, when they'd call ""flash"" and reply with ""thunder"" "
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking with the handouts- but wasn‚Äôt sure how to get the info to them- I guess we all just hit the streets and do word of mouth.. 
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Doug Bulkeley,"Dan, I love Band of Brothers! "
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Mark Melchi,"It's going to be bloody and most likely shooting, they're definitely armed... so let's make sure we have an organized direction of movement and direction of clearing or other Patriots will be caught in the possible cross fire. When shit hits the fan "
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Shirley Erickson,"So, is it yet decided, if it's this Sat, or Next? Is more time needed to organize. I am trying to reach out to people, but am trying to keep this on the low down quiet as to not let any know I don't 1000%, trust "
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,It‚Äôs THIS Saturday- we backed out last weekend- we have too many people we have contacted who are saying they are going to change it up now 
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Trent -Medford,Agree we are going Saturday to much in the works Dan What was the rule with long rifles in Portland 
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Mark Melchi,"@Trent -Medford. We carried in Portland with long rifles at all the events. If the plan is like it sounds, The laws don't really matter. ANTIFA always has loaded fire arms/rifles The actual Laws are pistol, can be loaded with a CHL, or open carried with no magazine for people without a CHL David Willis has joined the group "
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Mark Melchi,"They don't really allow rifles in Portland, Only if you're Antifa or BLM lol. "
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Welcome David Well mine is ‚Äúconsidered‚Äù a pistol. Lol 
2020-08-17 09:43:00,Mark Melchi,That's what I carry lol 
2020-08-17 10:00:00,Avatar,Mark Melchi 
2020-08-17 10:00:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,I have to keep it very close- cause I KNOW @Trent -Medford has his eye on it. Lol We will also be bringing two cases of water- they are in the freezer now... that is other things we need to think of as well. Also need people to bring some oranges and protein bars I have a wagon that we can put our big cooler in and have at the daytime rally with water in it and what ever else 
2020-08-17 10:00:00,Trent -Medford,So if he have a concealment license you can carry a loaded long rifle right?Ôøº 
2020-08-17 10:00:00,Mark Melchi,"Yes  City Code, Charter & Policies Chapter 14A.60 Weapons and Explosives | The City of Portland, Oregon portlandoregon.gov "
2020-08-17 10:00:00,David Willis,You can open carry any weapon as long as its unloaded without a chl Paintball guns are also allowed mine is loaded with rubber balls 
2020-08-17 10:00:00,Dan-Medford,"Awesome. Good to know. Also, this guy. Hell yeah https://youtu.be/YX-as0oCWkY "
2020-08-17 10:00:00,David Willis,Want to make sure people dobt underestimate antifa. They have been battling the police and feds for 80 days yes they have had there asses kicked alot but they are also battle tested. Yes i know they all are soy boys but even Soy boys can be dangerous. Also we need folks to carry a small spray or squeeze bottle of a mix of 50% water 50% reg milk of magnesia (not mint) to clear your eyes if you get sprayed. Also saline or eye drops and baby wipes. I have been sprayed alot it will not cure it 100% but it will get ypu back in the game or get you home. 
2020-08-17 10:00:00,Tony,I hope that we all are having conversation with our maker.. 
2020-08-17 10:36:00,Dan-Medford,"You corner a scared animal, and they become the most ferocious thing on the planet. Same thing with antifa. What I'm hoping is that when we show up is that we make such an impression that the ones that don't want to fight will run. Leaving only the true antifa. "
2020-08-17 10:36:00,Dan-Medford,"Also, just a thought, do we want to reach out to Andy Ngo in Twitter and let him know something is up for this Saturday, and ask him to keep it quiet? He's Against antifa and has been doing a good job documenting what's really going on. Just to give him a heads up to stay safe? "
2020-08-17 10:36:00,Mark Melchi,"My Group 1776 2.0. Has been fighting Antifa in Seattle, Portland, for months. They are all hit an run tactics from a few behind the main rows of people. When things get going. The Portland Ganges who also hide in Antifa will shoot you...Like they have done with a few of our guys. This won't be a simple fist fight. People will get shot, stabbed and beat. We have fought with guys in Portland who are like giant Russians so, they're not all soy boys. We must be ready to defend with lethal response. If we don't get to enough of them they will just comeback when we leave, just like the Taliban did in Afghanistan. We need to make it dramatic enough for them not to want to return. Suggest wearing mask and nothing to identify you on Camera...to prevent any future prosecution. "
2020-08-17 10:36:00,Dan-Medford,"Always wear a mask at these events. Well if its my time, then its my time. But I'm going out the same way I came in. Bloody and screaming. No more terrorists in my home "
2020-08-17 11:01:00,Rex,"We need to tell the feds ""we're coming and Hells coming with us"" and if they're not going to help... then stay the f..k out of our way. "
2020-08-17 11:02:00,Steve,Do we have a medical plan? An area to bring folks who need assistance 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Yeah- run some dirt on it and get back in there Rub non run 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,Trent -Medford,Yes bin working on that 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,David Willis,Everyone should have a med kit with atleast a gauze pad with a roll of gauze. 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Jk- I will have my medical supplies with me at a location.. if Trent finds a good spot to set me up... I can do pretty much everything needed there- if further attention is needed I can stabilize until EMS arrives 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,Mark Melchi,I recommend having a car on standby to transport injured. There is a Firesl Station with EMTs just across the bridge. That is usually our evac plan when we are in the area 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,Shirley Erickson,"Forgive me if this seems crazy, but Korea, panty liners, make great compression pads. For those that may know how, tampons work for punctures. "
2020-08-17 11:02:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,It‚Äôs not crazy at all... they work great- tampons are also good for nose bleeds that won‚Äôt stop 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,Trent -Medford,Shirley My wife is going to be pissed when she found out I took all her pads There fresh sent üòÜ

2020-08-17 11:02:00,Mark Melchi,Lol 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,David Willis,So are we looking at going downtown or will we adjust and go whereever the main vient protest mob is that night? It could be north precinct. PvP union office or east precinct. 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,Sean -PCOO Lerch,Where's best place to look for body armor at this late time? I do have a Kevlar helmet. 
2020-08-17 11:02:00,David Willis,Ebay

2020-08-17 11:19:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,I will also need a couple people to stay behind with me to run the medic area 
2020-08-17 11:19:00,Shelly A,For the laser lights...people bringing those too? What is recommended for eye protection 
2020-08-17 11:19:00,Shirley Erickson,"I live in a an area that makes getting there difficult, can't drive at night. Trying to find a way. I would be good assisting medical. Retired medical assistant, that worked cardio, pulmonary, and assist in minor surgery. Not near as good as a medic, but good back up. Hope I can get there Ramon Blackwood has joined the group "
2020-08-17 11:29:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Welcome Ramon 
2020-08-17 11:29:00,Ramon Blackwood,Hey all. Just joined. I live in outer southeast PDX area.

2020-08-17 11:29:00,Erik Neal,@Shelly A goggles for protection from mase. I think we will be moving around way to much for lasers to affect us. 
2020-08-17 11:29:00,Mark Melchi,I have a few medics 
2020-08-17 12:03:00,Dan-Medford,"I get first aid certification every year (not much, but better than nothing). Plus whatever first I learned in the service "
2020-08-17 12:03:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,We will need medics out in the field- but being a nurse - I will stay back with others if needed for things that can‚Äôt be dealt with on the front lines Nate D. has joined the group 
2020-08-17 12:28:00,Ramon Blackwood,I have very limited first aid abilities but have had some training and certifications nothing current tho. I'll help out if need be and carry some supplies 
2020-08-17 12:28:00,Steve,If I can be useful in that area I will. Six years as a Respiratory Therapist most in the ER. Im also unarmed with no PPD. I plan on getting PPD This week tho. We will also need to be security minded with whomever does the medical. 
2020-08-17 12:36:00,Nate D.,"Former Marine here. Father, Husband, Son and brother to all AMERICANS and Patriots. When and where. We need to speak to the Mayor, Governor, DA. What TF are they doing?? "
2020-08-17 12:36:00,Tim,I agree @Nate D. We need to go after the Government that allows the violence rather then the Pawns on the street 
2020-08-17 12:36:00,David Willis,Mayor and governer dont care we are beyond that 81 days of rioting ends saturday night 
2020-08-17 13:04:00,Tim,"But they don't care about 80+ days of Rioting when it's downtown away from their Ivory Towers. We should bring AntiFA to them, make them see the Filth with their own eyes "
2020-08-17 13:11:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Let‚Äôs stay on topic- we can cross those bridges later... The guys who are putting this together have been working non stop and actually have one hell of a plan in place- right now we just need you guys to keep reaching out to people you know and bringing them in.. it‚Äôs a numbers game right now...  For this if you that have been battling in PDX already- we need you to continue giving us ideas to help build the best plan...  But let‚Äôs not get off topic - what happened last night to that young man has lite the fire under the silent majority and the time is now... Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added Seth L to the group. Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added Dave- On Bluebelle to the group. 
2020-08-17 13:11:00,Tim,I wasn't trying to change the topic. Just suggesting ideas for it's objective. 
2020-08-17 13:24:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,No worries... wasn‚Äôt trying to sound rude- all great ideas 
2020-08-17 13:36:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Update on the guys condition via twitter: he is still unresponsive 
2020-08-17 14:12:00,Trent -Medford,So everyone knows we will have a 4 man or woman Mobil medic in place Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added Richard Bowman II to the group.

2020-08-17 14:12:00,Nate D.,I'm definitely working on bringing people in but be careful of the trolls and posers. We should have 1000 members by now. Hopefully we will Saturday. 
2020-08-17 14:12:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,People that we bring in- we have an extensive vetting process- has worked so far..

Rise up silent majority, 3 percenters ,veterans ,bikers , patriots ,patriots for prayer ,proud boys , 1776 2.0 ,and all other who rise up ! "
2020-08-17 14:55:00,Avatar,Nate D. Animals.  The more I'm seeing about this the more I'm getting pissed. What was the name of the victim? 
2020-08-17 15:00:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,That I haven‚Äôt been able to find yet 
2020-08-17 15:50:00,Dan-Medford,Last in the media they haven't released his name 
2020-08-17 16:13:00,Shirley Erickson,"Okay, have got my ride. She is medical also. We need to know what is still needed....more water, energy bars, etc. How do I get info on when/where meet up will be? I have a back pack with some emergency med supply so I would be glad to work more to the front for immediate triage. "
2020-08-17 16:20:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,I will get a medical list out together and post it later- I have my littles right now- so I‚Äôm kind of busy. Lol 
2020-08-17 16:20:00,Dan-Medford,"So in my every day kit I keep with me at all times I have my carry pistol, 2 extra mags, 2 days worth of food, 2 gallons of water, and a few other basics, including a med kit. In addition to your usual IFAK, I keep extra gauze, that stretchy horse tape (I forget what its called, you just usually see it around horses ankles), a few extra tourniquets, a moldable splint, and maxi pads "
2020-08-17 16:20:00,Nate D.,Someone get in touch with me about an actual plan please. Like do we have guys with shields also? Are we just going to open carry and stand between the cops and Rioters? 
2020-08-17 16:20:00,Trent -Medford,Nate pm your number

2020-08-17 18:15:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,PPB at 4 pm stated he was recovering 
2020-08-17 18:24:00,Nate D.,What they did to his wife was disgusting as well. Pure hate. 
2020-08-17 18:40:00,Shirley Erickson,That was a woman that they stole her purse. She needed it to get in her building. He was only trying to help her. 
2020-08-17 18:59:00,Mark Melchi,Yeah the news just said he is recovering. So not sure 
2020-08-17 18:59:00,Steve,There's a cure for that kind of evil.

2020-08-17 19:37:00,Steve,Enough is enough. I have some friends in Washington that would like to come but say they can't transport weapons across the border. Anyone know about that? 
2020-08-17 19:40:00,Doug Bulkeley,"We also need to remember Cannon Hinnant, the 5 year old that was executed last week. #sayhisname "
2020-08-17 19:40:00,Nate D.,Open carry is legal You can come from Washington as long as it's not concealed 
2020-08-17 19:40:00,Dan-Medford,@Steve how would anyone know that they brought weapons with them? Lol. But I've never had an issue with it. I moved my mom back from Vancouver in May with her firearms and no issues 
2020-08-17 19:40:00,Mark Melchi,"@Steve , Never heard that, their CHL isn't good here, but can definitely move weapons. It's an open carry state. Besides for this event it wouldn't matter lol. "

2020-08-17 19:40:00,Richard Bowman II,Open carry arms in PDX have to remain unloaded correct? Is that a thing? 
2020-08-17 20:01:00,Avatar,"Mark Melchi If you have your CHL you can have it loaded, but for this event I recommend being ready. Antifa won't be following local laws "
2020-08-17 20:27:00,Trent -Medford,Mark Does that include long rifles 
2020-08-17 20:27:00,Mark Melchi,I have heard yes and no with long rifles. We have before and never had any issues from the law Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added Ryann to the group. 
2020-08-17 22:35:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Welcome @Ryann Jason has joined the group Patriot Coalition Of Oregon removed Ryann from the group. Rory L. has joined the group 
2020-08-17 22:43:00,Rory L.,Good evening patriots 
2020-08-17 22:59:00,Trent -Medford,Welcome Rory 
2020-08-17 23:10:00,Rick Schneider,Evening Cody Benson has joined the group 
2020-08-17 23:13:00,Nate D.,There you are! Welcome Cody! 
2020-08-17 23:23:00,Nate D.,Man I wish we were all ready to go tonight. They are at another police building tonight. Would be a perfect night to meet them in the middle! 
2020-08-18 03:44:00,Cody Benson,Hello Nate thanks 
2020-08-18 07:28:00,Jason,Thanks for adding me are we all ready for Saturday?! I can‚Äôt fucking wait 
2020-08-18 07:28:00,Cody Benson,Has any consideration been given to the idea of some sort of uncommon identification in order to weed out infiltrated agitators? 
2020-08-18 07:28:00,Dan-Medford,I'm suggesting the call and counter call 
2020-08-18 07:41:00,Nate D.,We should be infiltrating them 
2020-08-18 07:41:00,Dan-Medford,"I don't think I could. One ""ACAB"" or anything like that and I'd be throwing fists "
2020-08-18 07:52:00,Ramon Blackwood,"""LIBERTY"" ""DEATH"" I'm guessing that needs no explanation in this group! Lol "
2020-08-18 07:52:00,Dan-Medford,"In other news, I did a thing. I say we go with ""Jack!"" ""Daniels!"" "
2020-08-18 07:59:00,Ramon Blackwood,Me Too!! 
2020-08-18 07:59:00,Nate D.,FYI I teach martial arts and combat training. If anyone wants to know how to defend and or how to use judo or boxing or jujitsu let me know. We'll get prepared. 
2020-08-18 07:59:00,Ramon Blackwood,Nate D I'm in 
2020-08-18 07:59:00,Nate D.,Sometime this week I'd like to get a group together that needs some brush up training or anyone needs a few basics. Ill be around. 
2020-08-18 07:59:00,Ramon Blackwood,Where you located. I'm in outer southeast. 
2020-08-18 07:59:00,Cody Benson,I was thinking of something visual as a way to defeat the predictable media narrative that we are Neo Nazi‚Äôs. Antifa will dress up a guy in stereotypical right wing clothes have him stand in our group and throw Nazi salutes while his friends take pictures or have a swastica on him for them to photograph. If we all have an orange belt or something like that and see a guy running around without one we can boot him before anything goes down 
2020-08-18 07:59:00,Dan-Medford,We're working on some kind of identifying mark for us. We're thinking just an uncommon color of armband 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Ramon Blackwood,"No matter what our people get tagged with, it becomes a ""Racist Hate Symbol"" and they usually use it to identify us and our vehicles "
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Cody Benson,I would avoid armbands. Wrist bands would be better IMO 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Ramon Blackwood,Arm Bands are always compared to the Nazi crap 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Rick Schneider,Rambo bandanna 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Cody Benson,"Ramon, so true "
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Nate D.,Vancouver 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Dan-Medford,When Medford had its big protest we did strip of blue fabric on our gear to show friendlies 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Nate D.,"But we could meet at a park and practice basic Boxing, Judo throws, then some basic jujitsu. It's a must to know a few things... I'll invite to my backyard after I meet you guys first. "
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Ramon Blackwood,Pink heart stickers. They would be hard pressed to associate that with anything evil. Plus it's cheap AF and easy AF Pink heart with a thin blue line Nate D How do I get ahold of you directly?? 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Nate D.,I'll send you a message privately in this app with my # 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Ramon Blackwood,üëç 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Nate D.,Message me if you want to learn a few basics. 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Shirley Erickson,"Identifier should be easy to see. Can be as simple as a bright 2-3in ribbon on belt loop or arm....waist up. We won't have time to look for it. A blue ribbon tied with it optional. Yellow might be a good color...eady to see. No emblems, as they will only hurt us in the end. Just suggesting. "
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Ramon Blackwood,I'm new to this app Nate D How do you send a message?? Colored ribbon will be easy to duplicate in the field and easily spotted. It would need to be very unique. 
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Tim,"Dollar Store sells glow in the dark bracelets, so we can be easily identified in the dark "
2020-08-18 08:08:00,Nate D.,Tap my picture 
2020-08-18 08:23:00,Rick Schneider,Flag football flags ? 
2020-08-18 08:23:00,Jeff,"The bright safety vests we have to wear on job sites, they sure won‚Äôt have any "
2020-08-18 08:23:00,Ramon Blackwood,Tapping pic doesn't work. But I found a spot where I can send a private message. But there is no Nate D listed. Last of J??? Yes they do have those vests. And they were wearing them Saturday when we were on the JC steps 
2020-08-18 08:23:00,Nate D.,Lol I should be in there. Try tapping my pic a few times. The pic right here to the leftüëà 
2020-08-18 08:23:00,Ramon Blackwood,"It just says ""copy message"" and ""hide message"" Fuck it! 503-477-2728 Moderator please delete this. "
2020-08-18 08:34:00,Nate D.,It should be bringing up a direct message option You can hide the message 
2020-08-18 08:34:00,Nate D.,Sent you a message on your phone Ramon. 
2020-08-18 08:46:00,Ramon Blackwood,üëç 
2020-08-18 09:01:00,Nate D.,No more personal numbers here. Tap the pic and send directly. Don't want anyone too exposed. And if anyone here is threatened. I will have your back. 
2020-08-18 09:01:00,Shirley Erickson,"When I tap the face plate all I get is this number? Aug 18, "
2020-08-18 09:01:00,Nate D.,They wear black. We should all wear Blue. 
2020-08-18 09:01:00,Ken,Nate D I‚Äôm interested in some useful techniques 
2020-08-18 09:47:00,Nate D.,I'll send you a message privately today. I'm working but I got you. I have a perfect system for this. A little boxing. A little Judo. Takedown defense. Jujitsu. Basics. 
2020-08-18 09:56:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,To send private messages go I to the members list and tap on the person you want to send it to.. this isn‚Äôt like other apps.. a mod or admin can not erase stuff- all I can do is start another group- clone you all over to that one and end this one 
2020-08-18 09:56:00,Steve,Nate ill have back surgery next week but that sounds like great recovery workout. Im in! 
2020-08-18 10:05:00,Nate D.,"I have some people in the group saying they can't find my Name under the group names... Steve, if you have back surgery you need to take several weeks to recover. Mma training might be a bad idea... Don't want you permanently damaged.. "
2020-08-18 10:15:00,Steve,"10/4, we'll evaluate "
2020-08-18 10:35:00,Rory L.,"What date, time and where for storming Portland? Brian Lund has joined the group "

2020-08-18 11:35:00,Dan-Medford,So there's a fund set up for Adam Haner (the man that was attacked). God bless patriots 
2020-08-18 11:35:00,Nate D.,Nice. Thank you! God bless you Dan! 
2020-08-18 11:35:00,Dan-Medford,"Thank ya! I didn't set it up, but I definitely contributed. And we'll get justice for him. "
2020-08-18 11:35:00,Nate D.,Yes. We. Will. 
2020-08-18 11:35:00,Steve,Absolutely 
2020-08-18 11:35:00,Ken,Awesome let‚Äôs help this guy out and buy him an AR when he‚Äôs recovered and recruit him Shelley Fenner has joined the group 
2020-08-18 11:35:00,Dan-Medford,Let's buy him a freaking tank 
2020-08-18 11:35:00,Nate D.,Hey Shelly!!! 
2020-08-18 11:44:00,Shelley Fenner,"Hi everyone! Thanks for adding me! I am so damn excited to have all of our groups working together for this weekend!!! PATRIOTS UNITED, doesn't get any better than that! "
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Sean -PCOO Lerch,David Willis: where do you get rubber balls for your paintball gun? 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Shelley Fenner,Freeze your paint balls Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added Peter to the group. 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Nate D.,It would be nice if anyone has extra paintball guns to help supply Everyone for a non lethal option. Charles has joined the group 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Charles,Is this for real? Paintballs? 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Some people do not own anything else - or they can‚Äôt own anything else- they are just being what they can Facebook facebook.com 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Charles,So what is the plan? 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Dan-Medford,"Trent has it lined out, he'll be posting details late afternoon/early evening. "
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Charles,Thank you 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Erik Neal,Marbles are a good substitute if you are low on paintballs 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Nate D.,Paintball guns are just an idea for a non lethal option. Imagine having 200 people firing paintballs at them. I think they would disperse and we would stay out out of jail. Believe you me I'll be carrying too. 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Paintball markers can be amped up to push more power- trust me - they freakin hurt and leave nasty ass bruises... So for all of you paintball marker carriers- see if you can somehow get your hands on Dynasty‚Äôs Banana paint- it has a nasty chemical in it that causes cramping 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Peter,Yes they do 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Ramon Blackwood,I have multiple markers. And I'm going down and throwing them on the crono. Gonna push them from the standard 280 regs up to 400 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Dan-Medford,So this was in my fortune cookie with lunch 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Nate D.,ü§£ 
2020-08-18 11:50:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,@Ramon Blackwood - ohhh snap!! Hope it doesn‚Äôt shred your PB‚Äôs. Lol What kind of markers do you have? 
2020-08-18 12:28:00,Dan-Medford,Its like the cookie knows... 
2020-08-18 12:28:00,Nate D.,There's definitely a new kind of buzz in the air now! 
2020-08-18 12:28:00,Ramon Blackwood,"I'll be testing them for the shred. Possibly freezing them too ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I have a BT-4, a Savo and a couple Oracles "
2020-08-18 12:28:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,We are a total ND family here 
2020-08-18 12:28:00,Ramon Blackwood,"I've never been particular about brand. However, anybody that shows up at the field and cleans house with a rental, automatically gets my respect üëç "
2020-08-18 12:28:00,Charles,My only worry is going without having my body armor yet. Hope everyone is thinking about their defensive gear 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Peter,Target number one 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Nate D.,Yep. I was just going to post that. Let's hope the cops leave him alone until Sunday morning when they pick him up off the concrete. 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Peter,Do we have any Intel on his location 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Avatar,Nate D. He'll be there tonight. We should dress in black and pretend. Infiltrate. Gather Intel. Locations. Leaders. 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Peter,Yes yes 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Nate D.,Oooh‚òùÔ∏è 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Mark Melchi,"Yeah he is on the run so he won't be home, we will be more than busy just in the and around the justice center.  But Ted Wheelers house us not that far away lol  "
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Charles,Maybe one person could infiltrate. However this late in the game wearing the enemies uniform maybe dangerous. I know a lot of angry unhinged people right now 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Nate D.,It would have to be before Saturday night 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Mark Melchi,Yes 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Charles,Just curious why we shouldn't make the 7/11 where it happened be the meet up spot? 
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Mark Melchi,"We need to get some estimates of numbers, if its less than 100 it's going to be challenging at best lol. "
2020-08-18 12:40:00,Peter,That is a positive location 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Charles,I think 100 armed strong Patriots can take all of downtown back 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Nate D.,Absolutely. 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Peter,I agree 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Charles,Just needs serious organization and planning 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Peter,He was at that location this morning 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Charles,Shit or just one single seal team lol 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Nate D.,Go to the afternoon meet on Sat. I'm sure the leadership here and all of us will come up with a plan. 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Ok- please hold tight everyone... all of this is already figured out- the heads are just dotting their I‚Äôs and crossing there T‚Äôs... it is a very well thought out and put together plan... so please refrain from bringing up other spots... 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Charles,Ok not a problem. 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Nate D.,Ok got it 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Peter,Sorry 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Charles,Not trying to change anything just kinda venting as well. Just my thought that we should be at that 7/11 at some point 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Trent -Medford,I Will be posting the game plan tonight for everyone and the rally point that we‚Äôre going to meet at so you will have all the information tonight thank you everyone for this supporting this cause 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,All of us have been on the phone around the clock for the last couple of days... trust me when I say- the numbers are more than 100- and it continues to grow as word gets out to your other groups and they are brought in... also- there is a surprise video coming I will post for you guys once it‚Äôs done... Here is what I need all of you to do- reach out to every patriot you know- get them in here... the best way is for them to join our FB page so they can get through the vetting process- then follow the post on how to get in here... that‚Äôs what I need all of you to do for now.. thank you everyone!!! Together this IS going to work 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Ramon Blackwood,Is there a link for the FB group? I was invited directly here. 
2020-08-18 12:47:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Go to Patriot Coalition of Oregon FB group- make sure it‚Äôs the ‚Äúgroup‚Äù and not the page 
2020-08-18 13:44:00,Nate D.,I just did. I was invited directly as well.. 
2020-08-18 13:44:00,Cody Benson,"That guys apartment is two blocks from my house, if I see him out I‚Äôll let you all know, doubt I will but I‚Äôll keep my eyes open "
2020-08-18 13:52:00,David Willis,People have gone to his house yesterday doesn't look like a good address or he is on the run. 
2020-08-18 13:54:00,Ramon Blackwood,He has 2 different addresses. Joey is the one that went to dude's house. 
2020-08-18 13:54:00,Peter,Ok

2020-08-18 14:26:00,John Kramer,Is 1776 2.0 in this group ? They came last saturday and I'd like to connect with them . Things got wild saturday so I kinda lost track of getting contact info . Also can I get group leaders to give me a rough idea on individual group numbers coming and from where ? People are coming in droves and I'd like to connect with a few bringing large numbers so we are all on the same page . I've been active all summer and am able to give info that may be useful before you all get here . 11/B . 
2020-08-18 14:26:00,Cody Benson,Just an FYI there is a big back the blue rally same day and time as the no Marxism rally about a block away. https://facebook.com/events/s/mother-of-all-back-the-blue-ra/2643586342568671/?ti=icl

2020-08-18 15:41:00,Avatar,Ken John Kramer I‚Äôm talking with him now he said he‚Äôd contact you soon his name is Mark M. With 1776 group 
2020-08-18 15:49:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Well this explains a lot!! 
2020-08-18 15:59:00,Sarah Stahl,We need to squash this shit. Saturday everybody mount up and let's make it happen or we'll be operation Red Dawn in no time! Let's hit Portland and hit it hard! It's GO TIME!!! 
2020-08-18 16:22:00,Nate D.,Oh we're ready to go! Good Intel. His house should be a stop on the city tour! 
2020-08-18 16:22:00,Erik Neal,@Sarah Stahl whats up with the SS badge? Lol 
2020-08-18 16:55:00,Sarah Stahl,Omg. Did they wear those in that movie? ü§£ I haven't seen it since I was like 9. lmao 
2020-08-18 16:55:00,Erik Neal,I was thinking that some colored duct tape (red or blue) attach from chest over shoulder to back would be a good indicator on separating us from them. If we haven't decided on it yet. 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Sarah Stahl,Awesome idea. We have a paint ball gun we need a part for also. üëç 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Ramon Blackwood,Easy to spot and easy to fake. 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Rick Schneider,The wrist bands you get at concerts? 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Ken,Rick Schneider are you going ?? 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Rick Schneider,Going to try to 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Ramon Blackwood,Wristbands would be cool as hell. Especially if they were American Flag. They couldn't possibly fake that with any king of speed or accuracy. But they would have to be ordered ASAP 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Sarah Stahl,I ordered 500 wrist band's just in case that was a good idea. They'll be here Friday. 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Erik Neal,"I know it is easy to fake but wristbands are not as easy to spot in the heat of the moment. Wristbands to join our side of the group, colored tape right before trouble starts? "
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Ramon Blackwood,A few ppl should have tape ready to go. If that ends up being the plan. Dont they make American flag Duct tape¬ø? 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Rick Schneider,Any one else got a confederate uniform? It would piss the poor little things off so bad their head would pop . I am also just joking 
2020-08-18 16:56:00,Sarah Stahl,I'll hit the store's tomorrow and buy a shit load of tape too just in case. Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added James to the group.

2020-08-18 17:21:00,Nate D.,If you can get to the FB link there is where it advertised $35 helmets. Just another thought lol. Would be nice to put sweet helmets on my fellow Patriots. Jay Thomas has joined the group 
2020-08-18 17:21:00,Jay Thomas,G 
2020-08-18 17:21:00,Ramon Blackwood,@John Kramer has a good helmet option. 
2020-08-18 17:21:00,Jay Thomas,When this shit all started I went to downtown Salem (where I live) and they were giving everyone on our side a green glow sticks with a zip tie to put on. I thought that was a great idea and great for night time activities.

2020-08-18 18:24:00,Mark Melchi,We have a guy in our group who owns an armor supply company. To late for Saturday but if you guys get him 40 orders of sets you will get all this for only $600 its a smoking deal if you guys can get him 40 orders. 
2020-08-18 18:29:00,Chris Tough,@thatsnotmyname87ÔºöHere is where he lives.. Address: REDACTED Address for Marcus love The bitch him kicked that man while he was down 
2020-08-18 19:42:00,Sarah Stahl,Man....I'd love to wrap his ass up. Gonna grab tape tomorrow. Are there any other options we should consider? Any more idea's? I can take the day and go hunting. 
2020-08-18 19:42:00,Erik Neal,Some drones in the sky would be awesome for surveillance. It would be great knowing if any potential trouble is brewing. 
2020-08-18 19:42:00,Steve,Do we have communication? 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Sean -PCOO Lerch,"I have a DJI Mavic Air, if that works. Can't fly it to close to federal buildings though. "
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Guys and gals- just hold tight- let out lead guys post what the plan is and if there is any needs- we can‚Äôt jump the gun on anything- there has been a lot of work and thought into this... so let‚Äôs just hold off on anymore planning... we have people that are heading this up- we have to let them get the information out- then you guys can pick their brains and ask questions... again: until that happens please put your energy in recruiting more. 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Steve,How are we looking on numbers so far? 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Trent -Medford,Steve shit man I can‚Äôt even keep count we have so manyÔøº 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Ken,Dude I can‚Äôt friggin wait to take the fight to these assholes 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Nate D.,It would be magic to see 1000 Patriots standing together facing down the evil bastards. 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Steve,Thats what I'm talking about. 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Ken,I‚Äôm one of 1000 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Nate D.,Here here!!! I think we'll be alright. I'm recruiting... Like they said we'll all talk on the day. 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Rick Schneider,Any carpool from SeaTac? 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Nate D.,We need a number of vans. Get downtown early. Park somewhere off path. Parking garage maybe. For quick exit plan. 
2020-08-18 19:52:00,Ramon Blackwood,NO parking garage!!! They blocked some of our ppl in and that's where the pew pew happened. Luckily there wasn't a lot of them or shit coulda went real bad real fast! That was this last Saturday. Those things have only 1 entrance and exit. And they stalk you all the way up. Best option I can think of is finding someone with a decent amount of private property on the other side of the river and shuttling people in and out. Or get everyone to a platform and load an entire train so we got numbers stepping off all together 
2020-08-18 20:13:00,Marshall Bastiaen,"Hello all my truck üöö can seat six with me if need, five comfortably I also have a paint ball gun and tank if someone wants to or needs to use it i personally have not fired it in awhile "
2020-08-18 20:13:00,Ramon Blackwood,Couple of local farm boys with beat up farm trucks and some large horse trailers would do the trick. Completely invisible till the doors open up and 200 hard dude's step out of 3 tailers and secure the area ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
2020-08-18 20:13:00,Erik Neal,"Another group has property right across the river in Washington, parks at least 80 vehicles and possibly access to a forty foot bus also. We will know more in the next few days. "
2020-08-18 20:13:00,Nate D.,Marshall. I might wanna use the paintball gun. I also have a van that seats 8. 
2020-08-18 20:13:00,Ramon Blackwood,Across the Columbia might be a long trip for shuttling. 
2020-08-18 20:13:00,Nate D.,I'm coming from the other side. Grew up in Portland. Live in the Couve. 
2020-08-18 20:13:00,Marshall Bastiaen,Nate D ill go charge the tank tomorrow 
2020-08-18 20:13:00,Nate D.,Awesome. Thanks brother. 
2020-08-18 20:31:00,Mike Bernier,"Ramon, That's a nice idea, but illegal to transport people in trailers. "
2020-08-18 20:31:00,Sarah Stahl,Drones YES PLEASE. Recruited a couple more people. I hope they joined today.  
2020-08-18 20:31:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,"Ok- sooo- again- let‚Äôs not keep planning amongst ourselves... I can tell you that the plan does have parking included... please, please just hold tight "
2020-08-18 20:41:00,Sarah Stahl,"We're holding and packing. lol Has anything been set in concrete yet? Was out of the loop for a couple day's? 48 hour's to put the cap on this. Also, have all the other group's been chatting together? "
2020-08-18 20:54:00,Dan-Medford,"@Trent -Medford has been finalizing the plan, and should be posting details tonight/tomorrow morning. We have a parking location, gamelan for the day, and a game plan for the night. I know we're all excited, getting itchy to get out there, and ready to show Antifa what happens when you piss off red blooded Americans, we just have to be patient a little while longer. Its hard being patient, its like waiting to tear into them presents under the tree on Christmas morning but having to wait until dad has had his first cup of coffee. "
2020-08-18 21:53:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,"I just spoke with Trent, he is still at work- super long day- he said as soon as he is done he will be going home and getting it typed up and put out... as far as a drone- that‚Äôs a no because if we are by federal building it‚Äôs a no fly zone Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added John B to the group.

2020-08-19 03:12:00,Trent -Medford,Me to brother ! 
2020-08-19 07:31:00,Avatar,Shelley Fenner I have offered Trent nearly 2 acres just across bridge in Vancouver and 1/2 mile from Vancouver mall (which is dead) for parking meet up. I can probably get 60- 80 cars in here and mall could be overflow. He's got great plans in motion. Our numbers are great. We have dozens of groups activating and coming together for one common goal. I freaking love America! Reaching out to right aligned media today. I have 3 or 4 of the major live streamers ready to go. This will be epic. PATRIOTS UNITED AND RISING! 
2020-08-19 07:55:00,Marshall Bastiaen,"Good morning daily chatter, been a long week for all of us so far, gearing up for this from what I gather we need to be leaving early i once again am offering ryd share i have four available seats üí∫ please let me know plus an 8 ft bed to haul stuff , Trent if you or anyone need a half way point that live south of Eugene your welcome to crash at my place bring a bed roll "
2020-08-19 07:55:00,Nate D.,Meeting in Vancouver couldn't be more perfect for me lol. I'm still available until Saturday if anyone would like to meet up and learn some self defense just holler. We can meet in the Couve. Also if anyone needs help with ANYTHING while in Vancouver just ask. I'm there 
2020-08-19 07:55:00,Steve,"I should be rolling into Portland around 4pm. I need to know how, when and where to meet up. Blue shirt, helmet, ready! "
2020-08-19 08:01:00,Dan-Medford,"For those of you that haven't seen it, @Trent -Medford has posted the game plan on the Operation Homefront chat. "
2020-08-19 08:01:00,Jason,How do I get into that chat? 
2020-08-19 08:01:00,Ramon Blackwood,Ditto

2020-08-19 08:23:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,If people want to meet up and car pool- more than welcome to meet at my house in Albany... Rigs will be safe Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added Dave to the group. 
2020-08-19 08:23:00,Dan-Medford,Game plan for Saturday. Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added Robert Carroll to the group. 
2020-08-19 08:23:00,Dan-Medford,"So the plan is to meet Saturday 10 am sharp at the Vancouver property ( 7415 NE 58Th st in Vancouver 10 am). The rally starts at 11am, so we don‚Äôt have much time so on the property we can fit around 80 cars there and have parking overflow at the mall .5 miles away. So I want to have a quick meeting to go over the plan in place for the day of. We are going to have 4 team leaders in place , a security detail leader, a mobile medic, and on site medic team So at this rally it‚Äôs going to be 4 teams entering from different streets and different times roughly 15 minutes apart. So the team leader are the leads in place follow their orders please a lot of time has been put into this. As far as long rifles and side arms, the only long rifles are going to be the security detail and all the conceal and open carry please no mag in it. Have it empty, and mag in your pocket during the day at the protest. There are going to be a lot of federal agents under cover in the crowds and police present so "
2020-08-19 08:23:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,@Robert Carroll - this one 
2020-08-19 08:23:00,Dan-Medford,"There are going to be a lot of federal agents under cover in the crowds and police present so please have mags in pocket for when shit hits the fan. We are going there not to engage but will retaliate if they engage. Please follow the team leaders, let them call the shot please. We want to keep this organized. So this is from 11 am to 3 pm And then we are going to have a night outing as well and location for that will be decided day of, depending on where we are needed. Thank you everyone for contributing to this cause it will be big and heard Just remember we are going to be have nation wide attention, So we need to be organized. There will be a ton of people there But our fun will be Saturday night Each group will park by there designated street entrance and walk in at there time with the group you are with so no one is alone And no garage parking not safe Park on street 3 blocks away and walk in safer that way. Everyone wear blue shirt, I think that will be the simplest to id Everyone wear blue shirt, I think that will be the simplest to identify each other and we will have safe word in place if any one is in question day of. "
2020-08-19 08:23:00,Jason,Let‚Äôs not use the word pineapple that could be confusing to some üòÇ 
2020-08-19 08:23:00,Nate D.,Abraham!!! 
2020-08-19 08:23:00,Mark Melchi,"Hey guys, I guess I miss understood something originally. All the groups we have coming is for the night clearing operation or for the back the blue event in the day? I thought the night operation was the real focus. Just trying to clarify so I can correct with my members as well. "
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Nate D.,Both are important in my opinion. I plan to be there all day and night until the streets are clear lol. 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Jason,I think most are in favor of both. A huge show of presence in the day to let them know we are here and a night op to show that we are done fucking around 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Nate D.,Exactly 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Mark Melchi,Ok. 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Ramon Blackwood,"What I've heard a couple ppl talking about was coming for morning op then leaving at around for for a bit of sleep if they can get it, then coming back to be out all night. But it wasn't a group plan. Just a few individuals personal planning At around 4 "
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Ok- so the reason for the daytime one is 1. To support other Patriots who are there 2. To spread the word about our night raid and recruit them to come Not everyone will be at the daytime one 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Mark Melchi,Ok 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Nate D.,Hopefully this will spark more Patriots to come forward in THEIR cities. 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Sean -PCOO Eugene,"Blue shirt question: Light or dark blue? My thought is light, it will be easier to see at night time.ü§î "
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,"This is why we must remain professional... we WILL be being watched... especially with all of us wearing blue...  Now of course our attire, mindset and other things will switch when night begins to fall...  We need people to bring water... I am bringing a cooler full of frozen water bottles- this way I can fit more in the cool- and a wagon to have the cooler in...  We also need oranges- need to keep immune system up. "
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Nate D.,Are we still going with American flag tape around arms? Or no? 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,"No other identifying marks... other than the shirt... let‚Äôs say a medium blue... this is for the daytime... night time attire will change- as will the attitude...  Daytime we are to be respectful, calm, quiet, only react if forced to... we must be perfect... night time- it all changes "
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Nate D.,Copy that 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,We will need someone to bring red duct tape to identify our medics though 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Jason,Let‚Äôs not give the media any reason to hate on us. The more respectful we are the more tolerant the officers will be and the more it will piss off antifa. 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,‚òùüèº‚òùüèº‚òùüèº‚òùüèº Yes!! That right there... we are to be polite and respectful and De- escalateÔøº situations- they do not need to know the anger that is within us all and will be unleashed later... use it as fuel- 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Nate D.,We can't just smush protestors either. We HAVE to wait until they are violent. 
2020-08-19 08:32:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Our main mission for day time is to back up those who are flexing their 1A and to recruit for the evening event 
2020-08-19 08:51:00,Dan-Medford,"When it gets dark though, we can HULK SMASH the rioters "
2020-08-19 08:51:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª For those that are coming during the daytime- please do not let the numbers worry you.. some people are not coming to the daytime one- they are only coming for the evening one... numbers will rise- a lot... So for today- here is what I need you guys to do- recruit- recruit- recruit... if you have ideas - please DM me or Dan... Trent is super busy today- he has lots going on- so let‚Äôs give him a break- thank you 
2020-08-19 08:51:00,Mark Melchi,Ok perfect. Do we have a link up time for the night time? Is it the same location? Most rioters don't come out until 10pm. 
2020-08-19 09:09:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Same with adding people - DM Dan or I about them... if you know them personally... if they are people from other groups you belong to- have them join our FB page so our mods can vet them and they can follow how to get here from there Yes Mark we do... but will not be releasing that until closer to time- it‚Äôs for safety reasons Also we will not know the target Antifa is planning to hit until Saturday- they don‚Äôt release that until the day off- so our leaders will be working on dialing in the evening plan during the daytime once the location of the hit is released 
2020-08-19 09:09:00,Steve,Ill be there for the evening plan. Ill wait for time and location to join with you. 
2020-08-19 09:19:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Perfect - thank you 
2020-08-19 09:53:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,If anyone is friends with Nun Ya Annette- can you please go in to her post about a meeting on Saturday at noon for Patriot Coalition of Oregon and let them know that she is NOT part of this group and does NOT represent this group and has NO right to use this groups name please... 
2020-08-19 09:53:00,Shirley Erickson,I work from a phone only....how do I find out the plan? I really just need to know the meet up place. A private message would work. 
2020-08-19 10:00:00,Dan-Medford,I'll message it to ya 
2020-08-19 10:14:00,Shirley Erickson,Bless you Patriot Coalition Of Oregon added John W to the group. 
2020-08-19 10:23:00,Dan-Medford,"Sent Remember everyone, we have a plan in place. I've shared the basic outline, we will go over details in person on Saturday. We're trying to limit how much is being said via tech. Biggest thing to remember: during the rally at daytime we need to behave. Respond accordingly if they get aggressive with us, but don't be starting anything. When night falls and they show up in their ""battle rattle"", that's when we can show them what happens when you step on the rattlesnake. "
2020-08-19 10:23:00,Erik Neal,Can we get some drums together for psychological purposes? Lol

2020-08-19 11:15:00,James,I'm too dam busy working to follow all this conversation. But here's an idea I have a couple 48' trailers id have to empty one into the other for Saturday but if we can use my trailer I can Shuttle a lot of people. I would just need a secure offload site and designate the secured pick up site. Could also be a make shift infirmary/whatever. 
2020-08-19 11:15:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,James DM Trent with that idea- thank you

2020-08-19 12:13:00,Cody Benson,Right. You got to know what you are aiming at in order to reach the place you want to be. 
2020-08-19 12:13:00,Nate D.,We should bring a shit load of job applications ü§£

2020-08-19 12:16:00,Nate D.,We need to maintain a presence then. This won't be over until there IS peace... 
2020-08-19 12:27:00,Dan-Medford,"Hopefully us doing this wakes up the local population up there and they take up the torch. I'd be up there every day if I could, but I've got things to do here in Southern Oregon (damn adulting) "

2020-08-19 12:27:00,Dan-Medford,I think we should sue ANTIFA for expenses. Since some of them are suing LEO and city governments for bs

2020-08-19 15:20:00,Peter,Ok thanks 
2020-08-19 15:20:00,John Kramer,We found that antifas shield wall is maned with gas masks and the second man behind them has defence spray also in a mask . Patriots that have mask should at this point suit up before engaging . Tactics to be determined. 
2020-08-19 15:20:00,Nate D.,My offer is still open in Vancouver as well. 
2020-08-19 15:20:00,Erik Neal,@Marshall Bastiaen one 55 gallon drum will make three shields. 
2020-08-19 15:20:00,Mark Melchi,This is what we developed for their wall of degenerates. Lol It's a fire extinguisher BBQ machine. 
2020-08-19 15:20:00,Nate D.,üò≤

2020-08-19 15:33:00,Peter,Found that 
2020-08-19 15:33:00,Mark Melchi,"I usually puff it a few times so they know it's not mace. They usually back off You will see these kids with mask Don't realky care about pepper spray, we developed this to wake them up and back up. "
2020-08-19 15:33:00,Ken,That‚Äôs bad ass I want one 
2020-08-19 15:33:00,Steve,"Heck, we should lead with that!ü§´ "
2020-08-19 15:33:00,American Love 45,I think im going to go get some torches now tooü§£ 
2020-08-19 15:46:00,Steve,You back em up and blind em and we'll rush the line and get busy. 
2020-08-19 16:21:00,Marshall Bastiaen,Erik Neal I can bring it to you tomorrow at shield üõ° defense I was thinking bottom as well 
2020-08-19 16:21:00,John Kramer,"Mark , please bring a extra for me as I'm a excellent at such things üòÅ "
2020-08-19 16:39:00,Ken,What about a lighter and a couple cans of starting fluid ?? 
2020-08-19 16:55:00,Mark Melchi,@Ken we should have enough. 
2020-08-19 16:55:00,Richard Bowman II,"It is important to keep in mind that Antifas shield defense is fundamentally weak as these half barrel shields allow for no overlap, which is the essence of its strength.  The reason they have a second behind them with pepper spray is that they know this.  They will enact a Cannae tactic.  What does this mean.  It means they will allow for breaks in their line, from which point surrounding elements and rear ranks will then isolate and engage with superior numbers.  Therefore all engagements with opposing shields must not be done cowboy style.  It must remain measured, tight and controlled. Once a general engagement is joined the line must then deploy in wolf packs of 3 to 4 combatants , allowing for local superiority of attack and defense.  My military historian coupled with intimate knowledge of Black Bloc tactics 2 cents ;) "
2020-08-19 16:55:00,Nate D.,Chief Lovell's Statement on Arson to Multnomah County Building and Call to Action portlandoregon.gov PPD are asking civilians to stand up 
2020-08-19 16:55:00,Steve,They got it! We'll be there. 
2020-08-19 16:55:00,Erik Neal,Three percent Republic of Oregon's Facebook page just got shutdown. 
2020-08-19 16:55:00,Dan-Medford,I'll glad stand up! What?! Why? 
2020-08-19 17:07:00,American Love 45,What?! Do we have a way to raise funds for incase we need bail money for people? 
2020-08-19 17:16:00,Steve,"Our forefathers said we the people have not only the right, but the responsibility to defend our country against a tyrannical government and invaders both foreign and domestic. They were brilliant: our constitution is amazing and fearless. Lets defend that. "
2020-08-19 17:52:00,Shirley Erickson,Exactly. 
2020-08-19 17:57:00,Rex,At one of our meeting someone brought up attorneys? Do we have representation if needed? 
2020-08-19 17:57:00,Nate D.,"What does everyone think about that, are we safe from prosecution because we're doing the right thing or will we be made the bad guys by the media? We absolutely cannot be the aggressors... We have to let them get violent first. If it goes bad and they do we should all pen a letter to Trump. I'm sure he'd pardon usüòÅ "
2020-08-19 17:57:00,Ramon Blackwood,The media is gonna paint it in their own way to fit their agenda. I'm pretty sure the blue will be on our side tho 
2020-08-19 17:57:00,Shirley Erickson,"If there is an Attorney available, it would be wise to run it by them. Most important though is holding ground, that no violence starts from our side. It has to be self defense "
2020-08-19 17:57:00,Ramon Blackwood,They were this last Saturday for sure!! 
2020-08-19 18:09:00,American Love 45,I will put a feeler out for an attorney. Its a good thing to have. 
2020-08-19 18:09:00,Ken,So the timber unity people are doing an anti Marxist rally in Portland is that where we are going ? 
2020-08-19 18:09:00,Ramon Blackwood,I invited timber unity. Not sure what their plan is. Maybe a convoy maybe a rally. 
2020-08-19 18:18:00,Ken,It‚Äôs a rally in a park it sure would be nice to have some pissed off loggers with us 
2020-08-19 18:18:00,Jason,There is so many groups coming together for this. I bet it makes breaking news My wife told me to wave to the camera for her üòÇ 
2020-08-19 18:18:00,Shelley Fenner,"I was once arrested in Oregon at a boat launch, after a fight(that was self defense) because the OSP said I took ""steps of aggression"" I had moved from my original spot of word exchange to approx 5 ft away, but it was to flag a boat not to argue with her or fight The woman came clear across the parking lot and I waited til she swung first before unloading till knocking her out. A large crowd had gathered for her reunion, After fight n before before police arrived and they were extremely aggressive toward cops. I think they only arrested us both because they got scared of crowd violence and couldn't more backup. One was sheriff, one was OSP. Anyhow, the officer told me that advancing in her direction (and he didn't let me even explain why I had moved) was the reason I was charged. It was dropped later but I did have to post $1,000.00 cash bail until court. That was returned minus a few bucks. So just make sure it's self defense without advancing. Also if a self defense fight is separated it is like a reset, have to show its self defense if contact made again. Police won't likely do much and if they do, it'll be slow. They mentioned a lot of paperwork to do. "
2020-08-19 18:18:00,Nate D.,But I kind of feel like the 80+ day siege on Portland was the first punch and we're already vindicated... 
2020-08-19 18:18:00,Shelley Fenner,I have contacted several popular local live streamers who will be there and i will be calling a local news contact tomorrow. Also PT News will be watching the streams. 
2020-08-19 18:18:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Please- no media or streamers 
2020-08-19 18:30:00,Shelley Fenner,"That's for the event, not for you They are going to be streaming the speakers "
2020-08-19 18:30:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Also- we need to let Trent guide everyone - so let‚Äôs not do anything without his approval please- all ideas and thoughts need to be gone through him... for the days event- that‚Äôs great- but we all need to really watch who we are talking to about what is going on... Trent has withheld a lot of info for a reason- we don‚Äôt want to get shut down/out before we even have a chance to get there- I‚Äôm so excited for everyone coming together in such a small amount of time- I‚Äôm so very proud of each and everyone of you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 
2020-08-19 18:30:00,Ramon Blackwood,"Someone should call Lars Larson. He is a patriot, and our biggest voice in Portland. "
2020-08-19 18:42:00,Shelley Fenner,"As far as crowds, be aware that all these antifa and BLM people will all be pointing their phones if stuff starts. They like to capture even when they're the aggressors "
2020-08-19 18:42:00,Shirley Erickson,"I feel it would not be safe for us to let media have this before we are in motion. Any fore warning, might give Antifa the chance to call in reserves from all over. Just me. "
2020-08-19 18:42:00,Nate Jones,Absolutely no media outlets. Although Lars is the man! 
2020-08-19 18:42:00,Ramon Blackwood,Lars won't be there with cameras. But he will be our voice. We release an official statement Saturday at noon. I'm sure that guy would hold for us. 
2020-08-19 18:42:00,Nate D.,We don't want Antifa knowing our evening plans... 
2020-08-19 19:07:00,Shelley Fenner,"I helped plan the event and get people to defend it. There is no fore warning of any support group presence. The streamers are trusted, conservative friends that regularly stream riots and are fed up. They know the drill. They are there for the event for 2 reasons, one of the speakers, who is black went viral after being at protest, trying to speak against violence/ destruction and who was chanted over, pushed out by blm's little punks. They want her message shared out to community. The other reason is they want to show the BLM violence toward everyone who doesn't agree or dares speak differently in ""their town"". BLM/ant-thugs will attack verbally at 1st, and get in your face with their phone while antagonizing, etc. But they're cowards here unless they outnumber targets. Nothing has been said outside this group about who is coming nor about anything after rally. That's why PT News keeps saying it's pointless to do a day rally. "
2020-08-19 19:15:00,Member 161,I have a member that is trying to get it on the Facebook group and get in this chat this coming up from Salem. He's got five or six guys coming with. He's trying to procure a deuce and a half. That'll put some fear in antifa! They are planning on rolling in full kit 
2020-08-19 20:32:00,Ramon Blackwood,I may have a few loggers coming with their crummies. High capacity seating. Maybe. It's the timber unity group. 
2020-08-19 20:32:00,Avatar,Member 161 
2020-08-19 20:32:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,@Member 161 Pm me 
2020-08-19 20:32:00,Steve,Well that explains where they stand on 1A 
2020-08-19 20:49:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,They are removing a TON of patriot sites- that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt allow jack on our FB page- it‚Äôs just to vet people and then get them in here 
2020-08-19 20:49:00,Shelley Fenner,I was on Lars show several weeks ago. I have his direct email. He will be getting a statement from our rally 
2020-08-19 20:49:00,Mark Melchi,Yes my 1776 2.0 FB page was removed about a month ago. That's why we are now all on Website. FB controlling the narrative. 
2020-08-19 20:56:00,Shelley Fenner,That's total bullshit. I wonder if BLM is reporting the sites to get them down knowing patriots are rising up? 
2020-08-19 21:07:00,Erik Neal,"Black Lives Matter activist, mother of dead gang banger, declares war on 'filthy, disgusting animal cops' lawenforcementtoday.com "
2020-08-19 21:17:00,Ramon Blackwood,They probably already know that this weekend is a showdown. Not just in Portland but all over the country. People have finally had enough.

2020-08-20 09:44:00,Erik Neal,Whoever is going to the shield training you will want to bring all of your gear to get a feel for all of the weight and bulk. 
2020-08-20 09:50:00,Erik Neal,I will confirm later but I think we might do a potluck right after the training. 
2020-08-20 09:50:00,Member 161,Erik I have to work and am up in the Oregon City area so I couldn't make it but it would be nice to see the training someday 
2020-08-20 09:50:00,Erik Neal,I will post a video afterwards. Ok so we have a mobile catering/bbq trailer for today. There will be a potluck afterwards so feel free to bring a side dish or two. Everybody is welcome even if you don't want to train.

2020-08-20 11:10:00,Rick Schneider,Let‚Äôs make sure we are not walking into a total ambush 
2020-08-20 11:10:00,Nate D.,As long as we have numbers and know Their target I think we'll be ok. We know it's an angry mob of 1000 people. What's our play though? 
2020-08-20 11:10:00,American Love 45,Shes not in my groups or on my list. 
2020-08-20 11:10:00,Nate D.,Mine either We need trolls in Antifa 
2020-08-20 11:17:00,Trent -Medford,This is why I wanted to keep tight lips with the plan  
2020-08-20 11:17:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Might need to did and check photos to see if any match- also check in your groups posts and comments to see if anyone has posted info- she has somehow got info.. and we will not be going into any ambushes- 1. They won‚Äôt have enough people to cross over the river- remember most of them don‚Äôt own cars or are only on bikes. 2. They would be the ones walking into a shit storm 
2020-08-20 11:17:00,Member 161,The uber army 
2020-08-20 11:17:00,Trent -Medford,We will be fine What they don‚Äôt know is that we are organized and they are not going to know what hit them 
2020-08-20 11:17:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,THE INFO YOU GET IN HERE IS NOT TO BE PASSED ON TO YOUR GROUPS!! All we have asked is they you recruit people to bring them in here and the way you do that is have them join our FB page... we have a team the vets each and everyone first... once they can be verified then they have to take the steps to contact me and follow instructions... I understand everyone is excited- but please please follow what we are asking 
2020-08-20 11:17:00,American Love 45,We got this guys! I've been getting people from cali calling me and saying they are flying up! 
2020-08-20 11:17:00,Trent -Medford,"From this point tight lips refer all people to robin , dan , or me please This is essential you do this "
2020-08-20 11:17:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,For those who have sent me messages about people trying to get into the group and they haven‚Äôt heard anything or haven‚Äôt been able to get in- well there is a reason for that- they couldn‚Äôt be vetted as like minded... now I‚Äôm not saying they aren‚Äôt-but what I‚Äôm saying is their FB isn‚Äôt showing it or there is something on their FB page that has raised an eyebrow to our mods... we have AMAZING mods who have been with us from day one and they are GOOD!! They dig and they dig deep... and they will also ask for a second opinion if they get stumped... so please let them do what they do best.. it‚Äôs for our protection... 
2020-08-20 11:17:00,Shelly A,Her message could have come from one of the other patriot groups she is in that is also planning on being there.

2020-08-20 16:54:00,Erik Neal,@Marshall Bastiaen If you want. We should have enough shields to train with. The problem with the barrel shields is the way they are shaped they cannot be interconnect with each other. 
2020-08-20 17:00:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,IS ANYONE READYING WHAT OUR TEAM HEAD IS SAYING??? You need to follow him... period...

2020-08-20 17:00:00,Erik Neal,@Patriot Coalition Of Oregon If you are referring to shield training I am not trying to make plans or step on toes. The training is to get a sense of our gear and how to move in it and help develop some shield skills. I am not putting any plan of my own together. 
2020-08-20 17:00:00,Chris Tough,If we do not follow the chain of command we will not be successful. We need to come together and follow the lead on this. If you have questions or need info then get ahold of the lead on a pm. We need to follow the chain of command. The lead is the lead for a reason. If you have questions or ideas get in touch with the lead through a pm

I know it's a lot to ask. We will be okay! I've been out there with a lot less and was just fine. They will taunt, antagonize, act a fool. We are the bigger people. Your leaders are the best!

It's an honor to stand with each of you against the false narrative, violence, destruction corruption, lies, racists, haters and the evil and for our heroes who's hands are tied.

2020-08-20 21:05:00,Chris Tough,It‚Äôs our governor. The police have their hands tied. We need to remember that and listen to our leads come Saturday.

2020-08-20 21:40:00,Member 161,Fuck Scott. He does not believe in free speech nor following his own Facebook group rules. I posted a video of crime and the Oregon City crime watch group and he removed it because it was too controversial. Since then KATU news has wanted to do a story with me about what I videoed. Because it's a crime. They stand no chance in OC. Marshall Bastiaen changed name to Marshall 
2020-08-20 21:40:00,Erik,What a disgusting human being. She is a nurse by the way. 
2020-08-20 21:40:00,Peter,It's a fake profile

2020-08-20 22:36:00,Mark Melchi,So what is the plan for the almost 6hrs between when the day event ends and the night clearing starts? Most rioters and thugs don't come out until 9:30 -10pm. If we are to remain idle in the park...make sure everyone knows to bring everything with them and pack for that duration.

2020-08-20 23:03:00,Member 161,Oc will be fine. Oregon City PD and Clackamas County PD will not tolerate their BS. Let's stay focused on Portland. I live bus to the courthouse and will be notified if there is any craziness going on. And if so we can all be here in 15 minutes from Portland. 
2020-08-20 23:03:00,Cody Benson,Antifa is attacking the ICE building in Portland right now

2020-08-21 00:45:00,Peter,Late night thought... I was thinking about the amount of noise at which the antifa protesters make why not combat this with bagpipes if we could get one Piper with some tunes I think that would be more than sufficient to drown out there blow horns and loud noises we could also use it for different commands 
2020-08-21 00:45:00,Tim,Yeah but then we'd have to listen to bagpipes ü§¢

2020-08-22 17:37:00,Kathy Hoaglin,"Is everyone safe? I've been praying all day, worried. I can't begin to say how proud I am of each and every one of you. God bless you, and God bless America. "
2020-08-22 17:37:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Tonight is off- a lot of our guys were hurt... it was discussed that the plan was to go in again at another time and better prepared- we now know what they are using against us... we can‚Äôt go in with injured people- they need to recoup and heal... today was a win... they know we are here and they know they got their asses handed to them... we need to keep recruiting- we WILL be going in again- and SOON!!! 
2020-08-22 17:37:00,Dan-Medford,"Yes, we're all safe "
2020-08-22 17:37:00,Kathy Hoaglin,Thank God.

2020-08-22 17:37:00,Member 161,My business page has been attacked and I'm getting a lot of phone calls at end email. My business is at my residence. I think we have everything pulled off of the internet but... 
2020-08-22 17:37:00,American Love 45,Something has been happening to me all month. Gear up and be prepared for anything. 
2020-08-22 17:37:00,James,Im interested in checking out the scene this evening if anyone cares to join me. 
2020-08-22 17:37:00,Cody Benson,"Going to start organizing patriots from Beaverton, more good men and numbers will be needed "
2020-08-22 17:37:00,Avatar,Ken We will live to fight another day. Y‚Äôall are awesome thanks for letting me be a part of your group 
2020-08-22 17:37:00,Member 161,I really appreciate the organization with the shield and the leadership. We wouldn't have lasted without it. 
2020-08-22 18:09:00,Shelly A,So God heard and answered prayers. One was their own device that a angel slapped back down among themüòâ‚ò∫ 
2020-08-22 18:09:00,Ramon Blackwood,Everyone be careful when showering!! I tried very hard to be but I am burning like a motha fukka!!! 
2020-08-22 18:11:00,Dan-Medford,"So I just got a call from a friend who has friends in uh...federal buildings in a certain northern Oregon city. The agents and police in there say good job, thank you, and they made sure antifa paid for that pain we went through today "
2020-08-22 18:11:00,Ramon Blackwood,Fuu Yeah!! 
2020-08-22 18:11:00,American Love 45,Awesome! 
2020-08-22 18:11:00,Rex,Washing off paper spray 3 parts cold water 1 part dawn dish soap Pepper spray 
2020-08-22 18:11:00,Shirley Erickson,I am surprised at the news report on ch6. They showed very little and nothing of Antifa. 
2020-08-22 19:24:00,Avatar,David Willis Dont touch ur privates 
2020-08-22 20:40:00,Teresa Dianne,Glad you all are safe. And thank you so much for standing up and fighting you all are amazing men and woman 
2020-08-22 20:40:00,Mark Melchi,Thank you all. 1776 2.0 enjoyed meeting you all today. Looking forward to future play time with you all. Thanks for the hospitality. 
2020-08-22 20:57:00,Mike Bernier,"Mark, I want to personally thank you and your team. Please tell them that you all totally ROCK!!!! I enjoyed watching you guys work. God bless all of you. üëçüòä "
2020-08-22 21:43:00,Avatar,Tim Notice how they immediately cut to a bunch of American flags when that woman said that she escaped from Communism and she wasn't going to let That happen in America. Interesting editing choice 
2020-08-22 21:52:00,John Kramer,"Thanks to every one of you who excepted the challenge of coming to Portland today . The war here is ugly as fuck and bigger than most believe when I tell them . Hundreds of real men and women showed up and had my back as I had there's. Today we fought evil at the door with courage , vengeance and at times rage . The whole dam country heard us few today say fuck off and let's go ! . When yellowed showed up I was blown away as tiny said probably 30 would show. Well I think all of them did lol and it was a honor to fight along with you all. Keep the fight up as I will and remember you'll be remembered in history as evil will be stopped. Sincerely11/b "
2020-08-22 22:15:00,Peter,It was an honor fighting for and with each and every one of you I will always have your six no matter the cost you are now my family... 
2020-08-22 22:15:00,David Willis,We need to go back soon 
2020-08-22 22:15:00,Ramon Blackwood,Not too soon I hope. I gotta shop for some shit Did anyone hear about where or if the bus load of Antifa came in?? I heard a lot of that crap while we were out there. Then out of nowhere there was a hoard 
2020-08-22 22:15:00,Nate D.,What was the name of the woman speaker who had the piss poured on her? Please does anyone know? 
2020-08-22 22:28:00,Dan-Medford,"I think they just came pouring in from around the city. As we were exfilling out, we passed plenty of antifa at their cars dekitting and still patching themselves up "
2020-08-22 22:30:00,April - Bluebelle,"In case anyone is curious they are moving over to the precinct now, watching live feed... "
2020-08-22 22:49:00,Robert Carroll,I saw the PPB & DHS has the overpass shutdown so the fucktards can‚Äôt cross over. 
2020-08-22 22:49:00,Michelle R,This was my first event and I‚Äôm so glad I joined this group. I‚Äôm looking forward to the next and standing up against this tyranny. 
2020-08-22 22:49:00,Tim,@Nate D. Her name was Raeona Coleman 
2020-08-22 22:49:00,April - Bluebelle,Nice!! Nice!! 
2020-08-22 22:49:00,Peter,"New York City Antifa (@NYCAntifa) Tweeted: but 'what about' antifa milkshakes?  seriously tho, solidarity to everyone who isn't a far right/cop goon in portland right now. https://twitter.com/NYCAntifa/status/1297274733847875584?s=20 You guys have to watch this it good lolol God bless America shield guy for the win "
2020-08-22 23:23:00,Jo T,"Hey everybody, Bill n Jo here. Just wanted to say thanks for letting us come play with you guys today! We had some fun, learned alot and are looking forward to getting to know everybody a little more. Hope you all have a great evening. Bless you all we did good today! "
2020-08-22 23:30:00,David Willis,More shield wall it was amazing and the only reason we were able to hold for so long 
2020-08-22 23:30:00,April - Bluebelle,"Just watched them burn 2 American flags in front of the precinct, ouch , my heart hurts "
2020-08-22 23:30:00,Ramon Blackwood,What live stream is everybody watching?? 
2020-08-22 23:30:00,Nate D.,Thanks Tim Nice vid Peterü§£ 
2020-08-22 23:49:00,Ramon Blackwood,One suggestion I have is a couple shields in back to protect medics and the injured while they are exposed. Shit got bad a couple times. 
2020-08-23 00:10:00,Peter,Oh yeah Paintball guns Are needed ... 
2020-08-23 00:19:00,Ramon Blackwood,I had a bunch in the truck at the nest. We were told that we were not supposed to take them. I have 3 cases of paint and 15 Co2 takes as well 
2020-08-23 01:15:00,Nate D.,For sure paintball guns. Everyone. 
2020-08-23 01:33:00,Avatar,"Dan-Medford Alright, us medford guys are home. Thanks for being there today. Each and every one of you kicked ASS. Today was not a defeat or a loss, it was a complete victory. We completed our objective, freaked the living hell out of ANTIFA, and we conducted ourselves the way we want patriots to be viewed. Even though their side of the media is portraying it as a victory for them, they're only showing the last 10-15 minutes of the day. For over three hours we held the line!!! You all did a fine job today. I'm proud to stand with you! Ps: the burning sensation on your skin from the CS gas will go away eventually "
2020-08-23 02:00:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Wash really good with dawn dish soap- it breaks it down quicker 
2020-08-23 04:30:00,Peter,This is me The one drinking the monster It wasn't beer 
2020-08-23 07:47:00,Avatar,"Ramon Blackwood Throwing this idea out there!! What about some of those small GPS tags?? They could be stuck to BLM vehicles and we could start seeing where the group up and find their bases of operations. The car with the girl sitting on it might be a good one. The BLM ""snack van"" that rings in all their chemicals and explosives. "
2020-08-23 07:55:00,Ramon Blackwood,"Also, I noticed that all the explosives and paint balls were coming from the groups of umbrellas. We need a way to combat that. The ""fire extinguisher"" would have been a good one for that. Or maybe we need a couple 20 gauges with rubber bullets. When the umbrellas group up, a half dozen rubber rounds might make them think twice about it. "
2020-08-23 08:06:00,Mark Melchi," How cute, I made the Antifa all stars hate list lol. I believe that's why they sent a little one over to where I was standing yesterday.... so they could try and stab me, but a lot of us surrounding him and just stared at him lol.  https://rosecityantifa.org/articles/a22/ "
2020-08-23 08:26:00,Dan-Medford,"Mark, you're so famous! Shouting Turns to Violence in Portland as Dueling Protests Converge nytimes.com Trent is on the new york times! Lol "
2020-08-23 08:26:00,Ken,@Mark Melchi Fu‚Äî em 
2020-08-23 08:26:00,Mark Melchi,Yep 
2020-08-23 08:26:00,Mark Melchi,Always 
2020-08-23 08:47:00,Dan-Medford,The common sense conservative has the full livestream on his YouTube. About 23 min in is when the shield wall pops in 
2020-08-23 08:47:00,Dan-Medford,"If this works for skeeters, will if work for ANTIFA too? "
2020-08-23 08:58:00,Steve,LMAO 
2020-08-23 08:58:00,David Willis,Lets not over think this. Antifa has been fighting the cops and feds for 90 days and are very good against hold the line tactics and will sit there all day and throw shit at us. What they don't do well with is when they get rushed we need numbers and fighters we will crush them in the charge 
2020-08-23 08:58:00,Mark Melchi,"No, what we need is to stop playing games by the rules, envelop them on a few sides so you don't face their stupid shield wall and beat the crap out of them, just go around the wall. "
2020-08-23 08:58:00,Richard Bowman II,"@David Willis you are correct in this assesment. During the several times they forced our hands to push back their line we had them well beyond their lines and into the park. A few of them stood and dropped quickly, but the majority of them stumbled over themselves in retreat. We could have reformed a line and pushed them back beyond the van , which would have cut them off from their supply of mace , projectiles and other assorted trash.  That was until DHS gassed us and we had to pull back.  Ironic really , that the folks Antifa were there to protest turned out to be their best defenders "
2020-08-23 08:58:00,Mark Melchi,They can't protect from 3 or 4 sides. 
2020-08-23 08:58:00,Dan-Medford,"I say we dig a tunnel under them too, hit 'em from 5 sides!!! "
2020-08-23 09:11:00,Richard Bowman II,"@Mark Melchi honestly their ""shield wall"" , at least from my position, was perhaps 15 people, 9 of which from a count were small girls.  When we charged the line their shields fell back at a run, they didnt even try to hold "
2020-08-23 09:11:00,Mark Melchi,"Right, but having different sides envelope them at the same time they won't have enough assets/spray, or kids to focus on all sides. The police asked us to stay on one side, but next time, we don't need to follow that guidance since we just need to go after them and end these domestic terrorist. "
2020-08-23 09:11:00,Dan-Medford,I'm game for that Mark! 
2020-08-23 09:11:00,Richard Bowman II,"Oh I wholly agree with the envelopment strategy Mark, and I also agree that this is going to simply go away. They are misguided, they are wrong, many of them are outright malicious, but they are nothing if not commited.  They must be removed , as it can only escalate from here "
2020-08-23 09:11:00,Mark Melchi,Agreed! 
2020-08-23 09:11:00,Shirley Erickson,Please just don't forget us. Portland is in real pain. 
2020-08-23 09:11:00,Dan-Medford,We won't forget ya. Any time I can get up there to help I'll be there 
2020-08-23 09:11:00,Mark Melchi,"Well we got a kinda thank you from a Portland resident...minus the ""You may be racist"" lol "
2020-08-23 09:32:00,Shirley Erickson,"Mark, that is truth. "
2020-08-23 09:32:00,Ken,As the famous cavalry General Nathan Bedford Forest said. War means fighting and fighting means killing. That‚Äôs the reality of it we are at war 
2020-08-23 09:36:00,Mark Melchi,"Btw, if you had glitter on you, it was probably the vial mix of chemicals, pee, poop, condom balloons. "
2020-08-23 09:51:00,Mark Melchi,Security Check Required facebook.com 
2020-08-23 09:51:00,Ken,Hell I had Antifa attractant on me. üòÇü§£ 
2020-08-23 09:58:00,Mark Melchi,Lol Ken all day lol 
2020-08-23 10:36:00,Shelly A,Flaming marshmallow arrows to the umbrellas and their blow up balloons 
2020-08-23 10:36:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,@Mark Melchi Where was that ‚Äúthank you‚Äù at OHHHH. FAMILY!!! I screen grabbed a few snippets... I think they will put a smile on your faces üòòüòòü§£ü§£ In this video above- watch the left side by the car that chick was sitting on...purse guy was trying to get all tough. Lmao!!! How did that work out little fella. Lmao 
2020-08-23 10:36:00,Peter,You found that clip of me chugging the monster lol  Chk out this pic i found! Is this photo shopped? The only guns we saw were in holsters! We were standing the line with him most of the rally! 
2020-08-23 10:36:00,Richard Bowman II,"https://www.dailywire.com/news/leftists-storm-suburb-with-guillotine-burn-american-flags-get-in-the-fing-streets?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=benshapiro  Our action yesterday accomplished many things , including giving the blue line some much needed rest prior to having to deal with this well into the night.  "
2020-08-23 11:20:00,Peter,No that was a proudboy I saw him load it Hey had a paintball gun aswell 
2020-08-23 11:20:00,Richard Bowman II,No that isnt photoshopped. That is me in front of him telling him to fucking stow it 
2020-08-23 11:20:00,Peter,He 
2020-08-23 11:20:00,Ramon Blackwood,Portland police bureau put out a statement. They want to prosecute all crimes. So they are asking any victims to step forward!! ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ 
2020-08-23 11:20:00,Richard Bowman II,"""Didnt see shit""  Isnt that what Antifa usually says?  It was pretty funny. Some antifa girl that was in my face all day came up and frantically told me that he was pointing a gun at them  Welp, engage in commie insurrection eventually a whole lot of someones will "
2020-08-23 11:20:00,Avatar,Dan-Medford I found the next purchase for our next operation 
2020-08-23 11:20:00,Peter,Yeeeess 
2020-08-23 11:20:00,Dan-Medford,"Damn, Angnar got deep inside their lines! https://www.facebook.com/100000124034999/posts/3764823020198462/ "
2020-08-23 11:20:00,Peter,Beast mode 
2020-08-23 11:57:00,Richard Bowman II,"Had they not deployed the gas we would have taken their position entirely. After the initial scrum we were reforming the shields to his the line forming to our right, then the f'ing gas clouds hit and we drew back.  Lame. PPD would have let us take the park . "
2020-08-23 11:57:00,Erik,If we all had gas mask and a helmet we could have easily cleared the park. 
2020-08-23 11:57:00,Trent -Medford,Let‚Äôs look at this as a learning experience we saw what we can accomplish as a group and we kicked ass dam right we did And also saw the holes in our plan and we now know how they function So next time we crush them it was bad ass how we held our ground and yes we did win !!!! 
2020-08-23 12:08:00,Ramon Blackwood,"Just throwing this out there, but everyone should have their social media locked down if it's not already. "
2020-08-23 12:08:00,Erik,"There is so many different ways we can go about it next time. Shield wall, proud boy's as bat brigade, and the paintballers in the rear. Shield wall up and once it escalates have another group run in from nowhere and hit them from rear. Upon our departure it drew the the true agitators of violence while greatly reducing their numbers and we can use that to our advantage also. "
2020-08-23 12:08:00,Shirley Erickson,I like the purchase idea...perfect. lol 
2020-08-23 12:40:00,Sarah Stahl,"That would have been great to push them back behind the van, close the wall and then gave those 2 fuckers 5 seconds to exit the vehicle. lol It would have just been them 2 and all of the Patriots. ü§£ It's much harder for us because we actually care about people. We are considering the fact that there are teenager's there. It's easy for them because they don't give a shit who they hurt. Thank's for showing us that though because now we can give some sort of warning after they start attacking. You stay in the game after that then we return fire. They get lit up then it's on them. "
2020-08-23 12:40:00,Shelly A,"You know as everyone was retreating and being chased down the street by BLM we were up on hill by PPD. It would be easy to have had a group come from behind then...and then the front group turn back and trap them in the middle. Again though...numbers, equipment, and communication is needed. "
2020-08-23 12:40:00,Chris Tough,I may have 50 gas masks coming. 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Was just on amazon- can get full faced gas masks for under $50 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Chris Tough,I may have 50 being donated from Texas. Ghost patriot was given a large donation last night and is seeing what he can do to get us the masks 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Awesome- I also have Venmo set up- I will get the info out out later tonight... for those who can‚Äôt be there but want to donate... I will order what I can with what ever is donated and it will be ‚Äúgroups‚Äù equipment 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Jo T,"<<< this girl has a score to settle, lol. I want a paint ball gun! Am shopping this week for all kinds of gear. Can someone direct me to a good source for paint ball supplies, local/online no matter, price not really an issue. Also will be looking for masks. Going to Thor Armory tues for helmets n vests. Oh ya, anyone know where we can find good glasses for the lasers? "
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,I will also talk to my hook ups for paintball equipment for those who are wanting them along with hoppers and air tanks- I did find 500 rounds of rubber paintballs for $80 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Shelly A,Want to know too....and powerful hard hitting ones. 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Just found 100 for $25 Please don‚Äôt go buy anything paintball related until I get back to you guys- I ‚Äúknow‚Äù people. Lol Aka- the pros I am also going to work on getting us ‚Äúbanana paintballs‚Äù they are the shit and cause people to cramp up- god damn dynasty dirty bastards is what they use in comps. üò°üò° 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Ramon Blackwood,I buy paintballs of 2000 for 20 bucks a case. I had 3 cases at the nest. 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Peter,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5FS02N/ref=cm_sw_r_fm_api_i_QYFqFbVSR5RFN 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Ramon Blackwood,"And I can get ppl hooked up with paintball gear, as well as other stuff I won't mention on here. "
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Peter,Ok 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Jo T,"That looks pretty bad ass! Ill show Bill. Price is fine. I got hit in the head twice and they came real close to husbands eye....these little twerps need to be eating paint, lol "
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Peter,You can also adjust the fps I pelieve I believe Also marballs 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Ramon Blackwood,Yes you absolutely can peter 
2020-08-23 12:44:00,Peter,Are amazing 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,Ramon Blackwood,Very simple and easy. I have access to a crono and the tools. We can pump them up and have a couple guns that will tear down their little umbrella brigade easily. 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,Ramon Blackwood,No marbles. That will kill a lot of people. They do make rubber rounds for those guns tho ü§î 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,Peter,That's true ... 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,Ramon Blackwood,I have an electric speed feeder that can feed rubber rounds thru a pumped up paint all gun capable of full auto. Their bombers wouldn't stand for long. 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,John Hufford,Doesn't freezing them work similarly to rubber bullets? 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,Avatar,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon The reason I‚Äôm saying rubber bullets is because the paintballs won‚Äôt shred if we bump up the markers... if you bump the marks up too much they will shred the paintballs... then the marker is down for the rest of the day... 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,Peter,That is yrue True 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,Ramon Blackwood,"I carry a squeegee. It's only down for about 10 seconds. But yeah, you just keep shredding paintballs. I can get thicker wall paintballs tho. Then we can hit higher fps "
2020-08-23 13:10:00,Peter,Yup 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,John Hufford,I'm about to publicly announce my total ignorance concerning paintballing and paintball guns. Does freezing them cause them to jam up? 
2020-08-23 13:10:00,Ramon Blackwood,"Rubber rounds are more expensive. We would need to take up a collection for that. And limit it to a couple guys who are cool headed enough to just track the umbrella brigade and their paintball markers. And maybe a few of the more serious agitators coming at our shield wall with the stun batons. No! They do not jam up. Just have to freeze them slowly. Fridge first, or ice bath. Then freezer. Problem is, they don't stay frozen for long. Once they thaw, they start coming apart too easily. Best thing is to get in the thicker paintballs that allow us to crono our guns up a ways and cause I bit more sting. "
2020-08-23 13:34:00,Rick Schneider,Moth balls? 
2020-08-23 13:34:00,Jo T,Is it possible for someone in the group to host a training day. Where those of us who arent supplied can try stuff out (like paint guns ect)? We can all chip in for supplies used and make our shopping lists? 
2020-08-23 13:34:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,I‚Äôm sure Ramon can do training- if not - momma bear will growl until he submits and says yes. Lmao 
2020-08-23 13:34:00,Shelly A,Yeah I know about real bullets and gunsüòè but never got into paintballing other then when my unit trained us on urban ops. Just remember it hurt. Lol 
2020-08-23 13:38:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,But if Ramon can‚Äôt - I will get a day out together at a field and have the ‚Äúpros‚Äù come play and teach who ever wants to... be fair warned- it‚Äôs fun and addicting 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Lol 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Avatar,Erik We will have more shield training and hand to hand combat in the near future if anyone is interested. 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Ramon Blackwood,"If we want to go out as a group, I can get the entire field closed and we own the place. We can set up tactical scenarios or whatever you want. 47 acres of privacy Lots and lots of different paintball guns to try. Whatever ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We have to cover what we burn up but I can get it at cost. And there are BBQs on sight and pop up tents. It can be an event if ya want ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Peter,I have alot of experience in the paintball world along with airsoft Witch could be another option 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Jo T,That sounds awesome guys...lets make this happen 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Ramon Blackwood,"There is plenty of room for us ALL to get together for training in everything. Shield training, hand to hand, paintball, tactics, whatever!! Recovering our own people from beyond the line ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Taking out vehicles ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è MOST OF ALL We would learn to act and move as a team instead of finally meeting face to face 1 hour before doing battle together. Must be a planned thing during the week. So a date has to be picked and everyone who wants to do this needs to get the day off. Whatever it takes. Cause this is a business and Saturday is their biggest day. Maybe Sunday ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But I don't know for sure. We may not get the entire place. But we would get more than enough. "
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Ken,@Ramon Blackwood Sounds great buddy let‚Äôs do a weekend training or at least a whole day on a Saturday. 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,David Willis,I was the one with the ar style paintballcgun yesterday i had 200 rubber rounds they worked great but i did have some jams it could have been the gun. The make glass breaker balls that are rubber coated metal. They also have pepper balls but they are about 3 dollars a ball. Dont freeze paintball s it makes them wildly inaccurate 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Dan-Medford,"What we really need for training is a warehouse or urban setting. Whenever I do training for my guys down here in so Oregon, I try to focus on hand to hand and pistols. But when SHTF its not gonna be out in the woods, its gonna be in the streets. I had my guys watch documentaries on the battle of Stalingrad to give them an idea of what it would be like. House to house, room to room. "
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Ramon Blackwood,There are makeshift buildings out there. 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,So we need to run all of these training ideas through our heads as well please... 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Ramon Blackwood,The heads are watching this aren't they¬ø? I'm spit balling to help improve us and protect us. 
2020-08-23 13:57:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Also we will be gone Labor Day weekend as will probably a lot of you... but we will be gone for at least a week... I would like to let our heads work with those who are wanting to help with the training... remember- chain of command please... 
2020-08-23 14:42:00,Peter,I would love to help in any way possible 
2020-08-23 14:42:00,Sean -PCOO Eugene,Are we planning a way to deal with this? They might be ready to try it before November.

2020-08-24 09:41:00,Richard Bowman II,"So on one hand we are the militant arm of the Proud Boys , and now we are being represented in a video implying that we are Qanon followers misrepresenting Qanon with violence.  Meanwhile everyone involved failed to notice exactly what I told one of those Antifa kids.  That we are a grassroots response of proud patriots that despite its growing pains and flaws believe wholeheartedly in the American promise as it was framed by our founders and most sacred documents for ALL people.  That we too may agree that there are some things that could change for the better so that all may be proud, prosperous and free.  But so long as their solution to our social ills is the toxic top down slavery of communism and the immolatiom of our most sacred liberties and promises upon the pyre of our beloved flag soaked with the blood of countless patriots.  We promise. We will ALWAYS oppose them. "
2020-08-24 09:55:00,Rick Schneider,100% agree but being we as a group were featured I thought it was pertinent to pass the information on

Saturday we were there not to fighr but to defend, if that defense required offense then so be it.  When our mission was fulfilled we withdrew from the theater( we can address what went wrong there later) .  Antifa sees this as a retreat.  They later marched through the streets chanting we beat back the fascists.  They thought they "" beat"" us Its like clocking out and having your boss say you "" retreated"" from work "
2020-08-24 10:43:00,Erik,I was right there and had no idea they fired on us. It was a good thing we pulled guns when we did.

2020-08-24 10:43:00,Richard Bowman II,"@Erik due to the copious amount of media coverage around it, I can pretty much promise that if called on it they will cite Proud Boy Swinney pulling and aiming a loaded revolver from behind our wall "
2020-08-24 10:43:00,Shelly A,Who says it was loaded? Did anyone see it was? 
2020-08-24 10:43:00,Peter,I saw

2020-08-24 10:58:00,Erik,@Richard Bowman II since it was two different situations and we were leaving the area it might not go down like that.

2020-08-24 10:58:00,David Willis,Anyone who was in the parking garage can be a victim of the gunfire from antifa 
2020-08-24 10:58:00,Shelley Fenner,My husband was in that garage. He thought he heard 2 shots but he couldn't see anything for having been sprayed 
2020-08-24 10:58:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Allen isn‚Äôt a Proud Boy guys 
2020-08-24 10:58:00,Richard Bowman II,"@Erik oh for sure I am not justifyimg what was done, I am simply illustrating how the communist spin doctors will portray it.  I have been reading many of their statements to the major press outlets, and its a victim game from beginning to end "
2020-08-24 10:58:00,American Love 45,Hey guys! I cleared it with the Patriot Coalition and they said I could post my flag wave here for possible support. I host in sandy every monday from 6-8pm and Gresham every Wednesday from 6-8pm. Since antifa has targeted me im expecting the worst. 
2020-08-24 10:58:00,Shelly A,We were on second level when we heard it 
2020-08-24 10:58:00,Richard Bowman II,"@Patriot Coalition Of Oregon I stand corrected , he was wearing PB gear and was referred to as such by another Proud Boy , perhaps just an affiliate "
2020-08-24 10:58:00,Erik,There was quite a few of us in the parking garage. 
2020-08-24 10:58:00,Michelle R,What little assholes. I hope you guys get them good. This was my first event but want to be a part of more. What is the most important for protection? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll stand in the back because I‚Äôm not strong enough to defend myself or others. 
2020-08-24 10:58:00,Peter,Eyes and mouth 
2020-08-24 10:58:00,Shelly A,Peter...to clarify I was replying to Richard's statement. About the proud boy Swinney pulling a loaded gun 
2020-08-24 11:20:00,Peter,Goggles full seal and a good respirator Shelly A yes He was also firing a paintball gun aswell 
2020-08-24 11:20:00,Erik,We the people has a mole in their organization. The mole released a video for our side of the line and is putting names to faces. 
2020-08-24 11:20:00,Peter,We are on info wars Live stream 
2020-08-24 11:30:00,Erik,Agnarr and his crew are going to put distance between the organization and going deeper underground in a sense. 
2020-08-24 11:30:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,That is Tim Davis and Mark - can you grab screen shots and send them to me directly please 
2020-08-24 11:30:00,Mike Bernier,Just saw a Dr. Steve Turley u tube video. He loves what the Patriots are doing in Portland.

2020-08-24 11:45:00,Shelly A,That is actually what I was dreaming last night üòÑ covering the lenses with permanent paint on these camera lenses and their face masks 
2020-08-24 11:45:00,Annette W,Anyone have a farm tanker or old fire truck? Would be more than happy to be a water person.

2020-08-26 00:09:00,Richard Bowman II,"I still have plenty of contacts back home in Chicago. It would appear that much of the more malicious rioting is being carried out by legit inner city gang bangers , far harder and willing to go much further than the punk rock rejects that comprise much of Antifa in Portland.  Kenosha knew this and wasted little time deploying the guard , but the situation is rapidly escalating amidst rekindling unrest in Chicago proper which just played host to 66 shootings this weekend alone . The live feed and the reactions reveal a marked difference between those out to play and those hellbent on large scale destruction.  Unlike what we have seen in Portland, there are no DJ's , no dance parties, no Trump balloons, just laser guided violence and chaos.  This is not to downplay the Portland issue , but rather to draw attention to the fact that such escalation may trigger higher levels of aggression from the opposition, including in Portland, Denver, Seattle , L.A. etc.  Remember, for them this is the incubation stage of a Revolution. We have every reason to believe they have yet to show their hand. "

2020-08-26 01:52:00,Ramon Blackwood,He was doing a live feed. Didn't watch it all. Check Boop Troop Eugene. He was in all black. 
2020-08-26 06:27:00,Sarah Stahl,Yep. He also wears glasses and has a nose ring but check his pics. Look's just like him. I'm about to make Gina look like a fuckin Care Bear. 
2020-08-26 07:14:00,Dan-Medford,"We saw Tre earlier that day, but he was in his full ""battle press"" gear. "
2020-08-26 09:18:00,Patriot Coalition Of Oregon,Tre did not pull the gun and touch off those two shots... Tre was actually over where we were and was actually helping me get Antifa asshats away from an older lady... The kid is a lot shorter than Tre... Tre is 6‚Äô3‚Äù and the shooter wasn‚Äôt even close to 6‚Äô0‚Äù

Even though the kid did everything right, we know how the media works. Let's mind our P's and Q's and make sure no one tries to goad any of us into a fight, either physically or online. "
2020-08-26 09:42:00,Steve,Roger that! They moved my surgery to tomorrow. So we were sleeping last night at the cabin and a horrible racket around 0430 sent me outside locked and loaded. Turned out to be a pack rat. I decided against patching 223 holes in the walls so I got out my wrist rocket for a quick dispatch. Might be handy against the antifa rats..... 
2020-08-26 09:42:00,Dan-Medford,Possibly! 
2020-08-26 09:51:00,GSipe,We were talking about using wrist rockets on the ride home Saturday. 
2020-08-26 09:51:00,Mark Melchi,Looks like at the flag wave in Gresham Antifa is looking at Alan Sweeny and calling on others to disrupt this event.

2020-08-26 14:04:00,Tim,Looks like those half trashcan shields didn't help much 
2020-08-26 14:04:00,Richard Bowman II,@Tim its a combination of that and Portlands Antifa having gone largely unopposed for years now and being unused to real turnouts of opposition as we saw on Saturday where many of them didnt really seem to know what to do 
2020-08-26 14:04:00,Tim,@Richard Bowman II well they seem to be practicing now. 
2020-08-26 14:27:00,Richard Bowman II,"They have been at their training for years, including an active gym in Chicago and somewhere in Portland.  I have no doubt that they have something in reserve that is being witheld for a future state of escalation, but for now all the training in the world wont make up for the lack of heart they frequently display.  There is a reasin their mantra is not, strength, but rather SAFETY in numbers as that is typically their only saving grace.  Enough weiner dogs will eventually nibble a dire wolf to death Speaking of Wolves, anyone know what happened with the American Wolves on Saturday? Thought I saw something about them being there "
2020-08-26 14:34:00,Erik,@Sean -PCOO Eugene do you still need a shield? America wolf's stopped answering the phone three days prior to Saturday.

2020-08-27 07:32:00,Nate D.,Those are the kinds of people they would join Antifa. And our leaders are protecting those ass holes. Unreal. 
2020-08-27 07:32:00,Mark Melchi,Talks about how they were scared and didn't want to show. And never seen these numbers lol. 
2020-08-27 07:32:00,Annette W,Is anyone going to Keizer Friday night? Does you school have buses? 
2020-08-27 07:32:00,Tim,"That's a great Propaganda piece from Vice. They referenced ""a guy beaten outside a 7/11"", was that the dude that was pulled from his car and kicked in the head? "

2020-08-27 09:10:00,Dan-Medford,"I'm loving increased showing of patriotism and backing of the blue! But, we have to understand every time we show up in force to every flag wave we just draw antifa to us. Therefore putting patients who aren't there to fight in danger. We can't stop anyone from going, that's your right, but just be aware the Coalition can't come out to every single flag wave/rally. ANTIFA is expecting that, and are watching for that. We can't become predictable. If you do go to these events, be smart. Keep your head on a swivel. Don't do anything alone. Antifa is trying to goad patriots into firing a shot, so we look like the bad guys. Especially after the past week. Putting patriots* not patients "
2020-08-27 09:59:00,Ken,Agreed we need to fight on our own ground under our terms. All United together well planned with all of us Agreed We need to fight on our own terms all unitedÔøº. 
2020-08-27 10:25:00,Patriot Coalition,"Nothing is planned for this group for a couple of weeks... we have to let some people heal... 2 of our heads need time and we will not be doing any more until they do. One has a broken hand and another has a fx arm... so I‚Äôm making the call that we will not be doing anything until they are good to go... we have a date coming up and we will go ahead with that... BUT these rally‚Äôs and flag waves we will not be going. There is elderly and children there and when we show up or Antifa knows we are showing up, we are putting them in danger. I refuse to do that! So if you chose to go as an individual that is ok but it won‚Äôt have our group there or our leaders. As the ‚Äúmomma bear‚Äù as it seems my new name is- this does stress me out because I watch these live streams and I want to get there when trouble starts and go guns a blazing to get you out of there.

2020-08-30 13:48:00,James,I would like to know when the next meeting is so that I may attend although I did show up to one of the 1st events down in Eugene. I have not been able to attend much of anything since. And I would like to have a good contact up here in the Portland area that can help keep me informed. I'm a single dad running a business and a Patriot and I will be there but I gotta have a group especially after watching yesterday.

We have done this in the past and it has worked great...  What I need from all of you- do not post information on here- too much wrong information or incorrect information is being put out... this causes worry amongst our group and tends to blow up our heads phones with questions that we don‚Äôt have because we have not vetted the information.

So please bare with me. ** There is a lot of new people joining our group. Everyone needs to be aware that each person we add have been through a vetting process, a process that hasn‚Äôt let us down yet. We have very dedicated mods who take this task very seriously and who are absolutely amazing! So please give a shout out to our mods and thank them - they keep us safe. ** Belonging to this group there is certain expectations we have for each and everyone of you. First- our group name and members stay out of any conversations with people or groups. Other groups do not vet like we do and have had people get into their groups because of this. So PLEASE do not talk about what we talk about or what we are planning with ANY other group. Our leaders do communicate with other group leaders and we do work with them. Second- If we find out that information is being leaked out to others or other groups. ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY WARNING. You will be removed from our group immediately. Third- Do NOT share information as to rallys or needing people to show here or there. This causes chaos amongst everyone and makes our phones light up like a Christmas tree. If there is any sort of intel or information you have please message one of us personally- we will then give it to our intel team to dig into and verify. Fourth- We believe that anyone who wants to be a patriot can be- from being a prayer warrior to bring boots on the ground- we do not turn anyone away, unless they can not be vetted of course. Fifth- Just because you invited people to the group does not mean they get an automatic pass- so please do not send us a message stating you invited so n so and you vouch for them. If you think about it, how many of you would know me from Adam on the street? How many know if I‚Äôm male or female? Do you see where I am going here? ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è I have met a lot of you, but you haven‚Äôt even realized it. Sixth- Here is our heads/leads- and if they say something you can bet it has been ran past all of us and they need to be respected. Trent aka Spartan, Dan aka Bravo91, Chris Tough, Joe W, John aka JH, Pat aka John Elway. Eighth- Do not post your personal address or phone numbers- PM the person you are wanting to give this information to. Ninth- When we are called out as a group- PLEASE PLEASE mask up- hide your identity. Tenth- We will never stop you or say you can not go to any events or rally‚Äôs/flag waves, we are not her to dictate, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we will not worry about you. We also will never say you can not be part of other groups as well... but we ARE saying that what is said in here is NOT to be told to other groups. ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è Eleventh- Please do not post stating that you could use some help at events or up coming events to the entire group- please pass that along to us- we may have something in the works and getting ready to release it to the group. Twelfth- We do have fun- we do joke around and we do chatter a lot. What we are doing is important- we do wish we could go to each and every event, but sometimes our prescience makes things worse. We are not a group that wants to stir the pot or cause trouble but we are a group that will go in to help stop an issue before it starts. "

The scene where the sniper shoots the squad member then hopes to lure in the other squad members trying to save the wounded ? I hate basing real life on a movie scene but it fits this narrative. We are better than they. We will fight smarter, not harder. We will not risk our lives to defeat them, we will force them to risk theirs. Revenge is a meal best served cold. Just like the movie scenes, they want to lure us in. To make us look like wild rednecks at large. Remember Lavoy Finicum. Remember how they demonized that effort. We can't afford to lose anymore patriots and then get spit on afterwards. I am deeply saddened by this shooting. I want to make them pay, but we cannot tarnish our efforts to fulfill our taste for retribution. "

If the President has anything to do with their ""ire"" , welp it turns out we dont solve such issues by way of Marxist uprisings and militant juntas.  2. The issue of Antifa will never be resolved should it remain undiagnosed, that being they are a radical communist organization no different than the Red Guard, Khmer rouge, Bolsheviks etc , whose sole interest is the overthrow of this nation and every semblance of its founding, something Marx himself used to stew over.  The point is , these people cannot be reasoned with nor are they any longer able to be considered our countrymen, for while we believe they are wrong, they believe we are evil and will continue to act accordingly.

If you have not done so already, I would emcourage struggling through the tract of hate which is the Communist manifesto, and do some reading in Marxist youth movements , such as the aforementioned Red Guard under Mao, Bolsheviks under Lenin and Trotsky, the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot and even Mussolinis Black Shirts to obtain a portrait of our opposition. "
2020-09-01 09:39:00,Steve,"Some of these practices were instituted in our school system, years ago, in an effort to manipulate thought processing over generations.

2020-09-01 23:14:00,Shelb,Quiet because rioters don't want to get Federally charged if caught. Since OSP were made deputized as U.S Marshalls. 
2020-09-01 23:14:00,Ewok,"Just thinking out loud: If terrorists can't play in Portland, does that mean Eugene is their new play ground? They're supposed to be here Friday night! "
2020-09-01 23:46:00,Peter,Eugene is a college town 
2020-09-01 23:46:00,Erik,Eugene is a liberal town. The very first night of the fentanyl floyd riots downtown eugene was mayhem. Businesses were destroyed and looted. A taxi driver was pulled out of her vehicle and assaulted while her patron ran off. That was just the residents of eugene. 
2020-09-02 00:00:00,Peter,Right 
2020-09-02 00:33:00,Russ -Redmond,"We all, every last one of us, should sue the State of Oregon for physical endangerment and emotional and mental anguish. Even if it get tossed out would make head lines "
2020-09-02 01:35:00,Kahrheart,I‚Äôve heard the Eugene rumblings as well but haven‚Äôt heard anything solid yet. At this point nothing would surprise me. I‚Äôm about 25 miles NW of Eugene and my daughter & grandson live there. They could hear & see the riots from their balcony when this all began.

2020-09-02 11:44:00,Richard Bowman II,"With their interest focused toward looking like the victims and we the aggressors, which is the theme of their event in Eugene in sept 4 , expect them to hang around and try to get photos of attendees but nothing like a bloc deployment , unless of course they are given a reason to once again look the victim simply defending themselves.  With a full black bloc call out their focus seems to be on the Eugene deal "
2020-09-02 11:49:00,Jay Thomas,I wish I could be there!! I will be at a wedding this weekend....not by choice the ol lady is making me do it üò¢üòÇ. I will be attending the remember Jay/Trump 2.0 rally on Monday for sure! 
2020-09-02 11:49:00,Tony,Does anyone have anything worth posting in regards to what could be potentially going on in eugene this weekend? 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Dan-Medford,"Listen up Patriots. Due to new developments in the past few days we are suspending all Coalition activities until we have a meeting with all of the heads of the different groups that make up the Patriots Coalition of the PNW. We kicked the hornets nest when we went into Portland, and there had been some ramifications from it. I know we all want to be out there fighting the good fight, but there's some backlash that could land Patriots in jail and legal battles. We're not giving up or standing down, just wanting to put our heads together and have a proper plan moving forward. Now we can't tell you to not do anything, that's your decision and your right. Just know if you guys do anything on your own, it can't be done with the support of the Coaliton. This sucks, I know, but we have to play it smart right now We need to think about our families safety and well being. Again, we're NOT GIVING UP, just recollecting ourselves and planning on how to best move forward. You all have been doing awesome and working hard and all of the leadership appreciates and recognizes it. You have to pick your battles. A few of the factors regarding our decision on this are as follows "
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Dan-Medford,"1) Local government is placing the blame for the violence in Portland on Patriots. They want a scapegoat, and they want to throw us to the wolves 2) OSP has been deputized by the federal government, meaning they're no longer held to Browns restrictions and can prosecute anyone arrested at a federal level. (No more catch and release) 3) Antifa has declared ""open season"" on Patriots. ""See a nazi (patriot), take 'em out"" We need to be smart so there's not more Patriots lying dead in the street. I hate us having to go into standby like this, but I'd hate to see more Patriots in jail for doing what's right "
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Tony,Thank you Dan. 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Dan-Medford,"You're welcome. Again, im sorry everyone. I want to be out there quelling this communist uprising and threat to our way of life, these asshats are fighting dirty. Hiding behind lawyers and politicians to fight their battles "
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Dub,Yes I agree with you Dan good words and good idea. We need to all be prepared for November when Trump gets re-elected. It‚Äôs gonna get dirty 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,13F1P,The time WILL come when our assistance will not only be necessary but welcomed. 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Peter,I hope we can see that day 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,13F1P,Me too 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Dan-Medford,I wish it was today. After the election it's going to explode 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,13F1P,10/4: open season 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Cody Benson,Has anyone given any consideration to organizing more locally? I‚Äôm in the Beaverton/Hillsboro area and am trying to get a group together to protect each other‚Äôs homes and families should the need arise. 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,13F1P,"Thats a good idea. I live in the Eugene area, we should do the same. Once the leadership has a chance to meet im sure those projects will be discussed further. "
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Dub,Yes I‚Äôve thought about a neighborhood watch kinda thing. If these idiots come to our towns 40-50 good American loving 2a loving people to help protect our properties 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Cody Benson,13F1P do we need to wait for leadership to do this? I don‚Äôt want to take anything away from them but if I can get a solid group of trusted guys in my town I can then have them show up to events or become part of the group providing they pass all the vetting 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Patriot Coalition,As soon as we get home- we will be having a meeting- please just hold tight and no more planning.. thank you @Cody Benson - yes please wait.. thank you 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,Cody Benson,Understood 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,13F1P,Copy 
2020-09-02 11:50:00,David Willis,Hope this is resolved by the 26th all hands on deck will be needed we are doing gods work and have the support of the president yes sacrifices will be made by many but its a worthy cause 
2020-09-02 12:15:00,DeeDee,David Willis.. I agree üá∫üá∏ 
2020-09-02 12:15:00,13F1P,Agreed üëç 
2020-09-02 12:27:00,Dan-Medford,I highly recommend having local organizations. If your homes/businesses are under threat definitely defend it. The coalition just can't be making large scale operations like that one Saturday. 
2020-09-02 12:40:00,D,"For those of you that live in the outskirts of town, in areas of quiet neighborhoods. Areas where folks can go about their business without notice. There have been unverified reports of groups of antifa- like people organizing, training and gathering in these types of places. I will not go into detail until I have confirmed intelligence to prove factual information. But I wish you all will investigate any unusual activity in your part of the world. I am hoping this is an overreactive concern and we all can relax.. but if not, I don't want my brothers and sisters caught off guard. "
2020-09-02 12:40:00,Shelb,Always on the lookout for people who don't belong 
2020-09-02 12:40:00,Peter,Aha white shirts Aka 
2020-09-02 13:30:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"If anyone has a phone number for Trace, please pm me. Can't find paper he wrote it on and he hasnt read my messenger yet.. I Need to reach him asap :( or please text him to call me. Thanks "
2020-09-02 13:30:00,Patriot Coalition,Not sure who Trace is 
2020-09-02 13:30:00,James,"I hear alot of talk about brothers and sisters here. But i cant get a damn one of you to contact me. If your not aware of who i am. Im just a patriot like the rest of you, but possibly more so than some. Apparently. I waa at the no goal Eugene excursion. And I'm the Fuck you, Fuck you, And Fuck you driver of the silver F-350 in the MAGA comes to Portland compilation and took down the pos throwing projectiles at parade vehicles, our wonderful governor broadcasted about stopping violence in portland. Ive proved my patriotism. All while running a business and you know. Adultng. Ive given my contact information. Nothing. Ive posted here. Nothing. So heres my last ditch effort. Although it sounds like operations are ceasing .. I would like to be contacted by Portland/Vancouver leadership. Cody Benson im in the hillsboro area. You and anyone else in this area. Or not. Labor day parade? 5033416906 "
2020-09-02 13:30:00,Patriot Coalition,Whoa- cool you‚Äôre jets- I HAVE responded to you and I HAVE told you that we don‚Äôt have a specific ‚Äúleader‚Äù in Portland area that we don‚Äôt have sections as we use to... I also informed you that as soon as we got back we would be having a meeting.. so you HAVE been contacted... and NO ONE is more of a Patriot than another... so calling leaders out in a thread like this is inappropriate and WILL NOT be tolerated when you have spoken to me 
2020-09-02 13:30:00,D,I did get a chuckle out of that video snippet of the f-bomb extravaganza 
2020-09-02 13:30:00,Patriot Coalition,You were also given my direct number- and guess what- no call 
2020-09-02 13:50:00,Avatar,Patriot Coalition So be careful who you‚Äôre calling out 
2020-09-02 14:19:00,DeeDee,James..I enjoyed the F-bomb clips and well. Labor day I will be joining another Parade planned by women for Trump Patriot Coalition added Sam O to the group. 
2020-09-02 14:29:00,Peter,Security Check Required facebook.com This is amazing lolol 
2020-09-02 14:46:00,Dub,@James we all need to work together for one common cause. Don‚Äôt be discouraged let‚Äôs stay together and keep fighting the good fight. This is a great group of people and will stick by your side when shit gets crazy. We are here to fight commies and restore Oregon. Bless you brother 
2020-09-02 14:54:00,Dub,@Peter that video is hilarious üòÇ 
2020-09-02 14:54:00,Kahrheart,Trent.. sent you a FB message. Patriot Coalition added Ale F to the group. Daniel A changed their avatar Patriot Coalition added Davidson to the group. 
2020-09-02 14:54:00,Patriot Coalition,"‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è There are a few things that I believe need to be addressed. So please bare with me. ** There is a lot of new people joining our group. Everyone needs to be aware that each person we add have been through a vetting process, a process that hasn‚Äôt let us down yet. We have very dedicated mods who take this task very seriously and who are absolutely amazing! So please give a shout out to our mods and thank them - they keep us safe. ** Belonging to this group there is certain expectations we have for each and everyone of you. First- our group name and members stay out of any conversations with people or groups. Other groups do not vet like we do and have had people get into their groups because of this. So PLEASE do not talk about what we talk about or what we are planning with ANY other group. Our leaders do communicate with other group leaders and we do work with them. Second- If we find out that information is being leaked out to others or other groups ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY WARNING. You will be removed from our group immediately. Third- Do NOT share information as to rallys or needing people to show here or there. This causes chaos amongst everyone and makes our phones light up like a Christmas tree. If there is any sort of intel or information you have please message one of us personally- we will then give it to our intel team to dig into and verify. Fourth- We believe that anyone who wants to be a patriot can be- from being a prayer warrior to bring boots on the ground- we do not turn anyone away, unless they can not be vetted of course. Fifth- Just because you invited people to the group does not mean they get an automatic pass- so please do not send us a message stating you invited so n so and you vouch for them. If you think about it, how many of you would know me from Adam on the street? How many know if I‚Äôm male or female? Do you see where I am going here? ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è I have met a lot of you, but you haven‚Äôt even realized it. Sixth- Here is our heads/leads- and if they say something you can bet it has been ran past all of us and they need to be respected. Trent aka Spartan, Dan aka Bravo91, Chris Tough, Joe W, John aka JH, Pat aka John Elway. Eighth- Do not post your personal address or phone numbers- PM the person you are wanting to give this information to. Ninth- When we are called out as a group- PLEASE PLEASE mask up- hide your identity. Tenth- We will never stop you or say you can not go to any events or rally‚Äôs/flag waves, we are not her to dictate, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we will not worry about you. We also will never say you can not be part of other groups as well... but we ARE saying that what is said in here is NOT to be told to other groups. ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è Eleventh- Please do not post stating that you could use some help at events or up coming events to the entire group- please pass that along to us- we may have something in the works and getting ready to release it to the group. Twelfth- We do have fun- we do joke around and we do chatter a lot. What we are doing is important- we do wish we could go to each and every event, but sometimes our prescience makes things worse. We are not a group that wants to stir the pot or cause trouble but we are a group that will go in to help stop an issue before it starts. "
2020-09-02 14:54:00,D,@Patriot Coalition ... i thought you were on vacation.. we need you recharged.. take a break from this and enjoy God's creation.

2020-09-02 15:41:00,Patriot Coalition,We are doing devils tower and also Yellowstone... both of us were kids when we were there last Will also be ammo hunting as well lmao 
2020-09-02 15:41:00,D,I've been having real good luck with online sales of ammo. It takes about 3-4 weeks delivery but we have 8-9 weeks before election day so..... 
2020-09-02 15:41:00,Erik,@Patriot Coalition if you happen to come across some small pistol primers while you are ammo hunting I would really appreciate if you bought them and I could pay you back. 
2020-09-02 15:55:00,Jay Thomas,I was able to get 1000 rounds of .223 and 300 of 9mm yesterday at Coastal Farm and Ranch in Salem. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs gone now but that was there soft opening and they will be having a grand opening soon and the dude at the counter said they should have more for that 
2020-09-02 16:05:00,Raider12,Check out northwest firearms forums for ammo too. 
2020-09-02 16:05:00,Patriot Coalition,Jay if you go back and there is more 9mm please grab us some please- that‚Äôs what we are having a hard time finding 
2020-09-02 16:15:00,Jay Thomas,Will do. They limit you to 3 boxes of each caliber. The guy that told me about it was able to get there when the had 500ct boxes of 9mm for $100. 
2020-09-02 16:15:00,Patriot Coalition,Thank you!! I can Venmo you the money or how ever works for you 
2020-09-02 16:15:00,James,"Dub, i know this is a good group. Thats why im still here. And i had no intention of being on television. But, it is what it is. I was questioning going to this next parade. But my sons and a few of their friends are going. Although the parade isn't supposed to go thru Multnomah county. It wasn't supposed to Saturday either. If anyone is attending. Be nice to have a group that is aware of their tactics. Its not going to go unchallenged. Regardless of Skipping downtown. Portland is ground zero. It would be nice, if nothing else. To share contact info with other vetted patriots who might attend local events. I recognized their tactics. Many didn't and some people got hurt. Pics of license plates..... on one you tube video, a guy is seen punching a blm member in the street. He was taken out pic takers of plates and people blocking the parade. Classic!!! Hit and run. "
2020-09-02 16:15:00,Jay Thomas,I will be there for Monday‚Äôs event

2020-09-04 19:32:00,Dan-Medford,"I highly suggest Wimkin. New platform, very similar to Facebook. Very conservative "
2020-09-04 19:32:00,DeeDee,It's crazy how many people have been trying to join my private group the last couple weeks with new fb accounts

2020-09-04 20:38:00,Kahrheart,"Parler is a lot like Twitter, which I don‚Äôt use much. I‚Äôll look into Wimkin. Wish someone would just make one called ‚ÄúPatriotPage‚Äù. Wimkin, Parler & MeWe just sound so stupid. "
2020-09-04 20:49:00,Ewok,We have a group of Antifa at 8th and Olive that's getting louder. We have a few guys heading over from Elkhorn now. If anyone else is available come on down. 
2020-09-04 21:05:00,13F1P,"@Ewok , keep us posted. "
2020-09-04 21:11:00,Patriot Coalition,"Well.... We were out and about... and got stopped dead in our tracks by a F‚Äôing mob... Typical - blocking streets protesting- We had no where to go, we started pulling out our side arms and mace... then a couple moved and gave us an opening big enough to get the hell out of there... the Antifa over here are not a violent right off but you could feel the tension rising.. I‚Äôm glad we got through, but I am worried about the line of cars coming from each direction as it seems they started getting more and more agitated.. they are A LOT bigger over here than Portland, but damn they definitely do not shower over here either- they freaking stink!!!.... but we are safe now.. we will keep you updated if we run into any more trouble.

2020-09-05 10:17:00,Russ -Redmond,He talks about wanting to get like minded groups all under the same non profit umbrella nationally. The Patriot Coalition sounds like the right name for that in my opinion. It seems they are operating on the same level. I was impressed with how they handled themselves in the last 30 min of the video. Maybe we should reach out? 
2020-09-05 10:17:00,Punisher95,Does anyone no this guy Heff

2020-09-05 14:57:00,Richard Bowman II,"Hmmm that group is of course both militant and radical after the fashion of the Panthers under Carmichael in the 60s ,but I dont know that they have been linked to illegal activities, looting, rioting and unrest.  I am not sure that patriot militias openly confronted them is either prudent in ones choice of battles nor is it good PR in the current climate of everything being on the head of patriots.  If this pops off it is going to be placed squarely at the feet of good Americans as the narrative dictates that their presence was a provocation of violence.  It may be best to hold ones offensive hand close to the chest in the lead up to November, to be placed on the table when it really counts.  Either way, may the folks out there one the lines be safe  Patriots Up. "

2020-09-05 22:29:00,13F1P,"Ditto Robert, the system we fought for isn't always fair. Decent folk that do stupid things get hosed and dirt bags that know how to manipulate the system get off easy. Really sorry to hear about your son. Ill fight these shit bags by your side any day! "

2020-09-06 09:53:00,Punisher95,Enter soap box ...... For me today is hard last night a true patriot was involved in a hit-and-run I do not know the details however I have gotten news that he is in critical condition my deepest condolences to his friends and family I did not know his name until yesterday and the reason that I'm saying this is because a couple weeks ago I was at the back and blue rally providing security for the speakers and as you all know to whoever was there it was hell.... During the last half an hour about us exiting the Justice center I was attacked with bear mace to the point where I could not open my eyes because of how painful it was someone grabbed me and let me away from the danger I was a blind man walking I could hear the sprays of the bear mace about 20 yards off I started communicating with these guys it turned out they were proud boys they took me under their wing they defended me and they helped me get to safety this man was with me the whole entire time if it was not for him and the He gave me the last remaining water to help clear my eyes so that I could go and find you guys at the rally point I am truly saddened but this horrific event but I also am enraged I have no words for the low-life scumbags who terrorized this nation in this country the good men and women Port fighting to preserve what are fore fathers gave to us 
2020-09-06 09:53:00,GSipe,Punisher95 we are all in this together.

2020-09-06 10:44:00,Avatar,David Thank you for the up date on this Gentleman. I will be donating to his fund. 
2020-09-06 10:44:00,Trent -Medford,"On Saturday, September 5, 2020, Oregon State Police assisted our partners at Portland Police Bureau with the rioters in Portland. This criminal activity presented an extreme danger to life safety for all community members, and prompted a declaration of a riot.  Individuals within the crowd began throwing illegal fireworks/mortars at officers. Others were seen throwing rocks. At least one had a ""wrist-rocket"" type of slingshot launching unknown objects. In order to defend themselves from these assaults, officers used crowd control munitions, including tear gas. Officers made numerous targeted arrests.  Rioters lit fires in the streets, including dumpsters, garbage cans, and wooden pallets. Officers moved in to push the crowd back in order to extinguish the fires.  During numerous confrontations with officers, individuals launched attacks on law enforcement, including throwing objects. A sergeant was directly struck by a commercial grade firework, which burned through his glove and injured his hand (photos). Several officers and troopers were struck by rocks in the head, arms, shoulders, and feet. Only their protective gear prevented serious injury. An Oregon State Police vehicle was damaged by rocks, including broken windows and dents (photos). An un-exploded mortar was recovered by police (photo).  Over 50 people were arrested. At least two were wearing body armor. One had a dagger, another had a knife (photos).  The response to this event included not only Portland Police Rapid Response Team and Oregon State Police, but PPB precincts had to pull officers out of patrol to assist. That limited the ability to respond to calls. At about 2:00 A.M., there were almost 150 calls for service holding in the City of Portland. "

2020-09-06 12:56:00,13F1P,"The narrative of the leftist ""Press"" is embarrassing to intelligent people. At some point they won't be able to spin the truth without more people saying, that isn't what I saw. Until more people see it, we'll be the bad guy's in the media's eyes. "
2020-09-06 12:56:00,Kahrheart,We need our own REAL Press! 
2020-09-06 12:56:00,13F1P,I can mount a go-pro to my helmet. Im sure many of us could. 
2020-09-06 12:56:00,Punisher95,How about we disguise ourselves as press and then pick out the ones that are instigators We can play by their rules to If we could get our hands on some pro BLM stuff or antifa stuff and dressing cognito I think that would be really really confusing for them 
2020-09-06 13:07:00,Nate,It would be great if the beginning of every rally was taped and put our right after. We need to film the series of events and get them screaming Death to America and calling for race wars. 
2020-09-06 13:13:00,Punisher95,After what happened last night if I see people wearing black lives matter shirts or masks there instantly targeted in my book I have no sympathy for them at all whatsoever I used to but not anymore 
2020-09-06 13:13:00,Nate,Anyone who could support what's going on is definitely anti American and a treasonous freak. Bullseyes. The lot! 
2020-09-06 13:22:00,Punisher95,More like you're catching hands with me Honestly at this point I could give 0 fucks 
2020-09-06 13:22:00,Mark Melchi,"Yes, going after them at night is the solution. Day time yelling matches are pointless. Like we do in other states, tactical ambushes at night while backing up the police are key. You get the leaders and the violent ones and the police are happy to shut their mouths and cameras. They are starting to murder us and peaceful ways are over, Guerilla tactics are the only way we win this. We are seriously loosing this country...and if we are too worried about getting in trouble we have already let them win. "
2020-09-06 13:22:00,Nate,Zero fucks. Absolute zero. I agree Mark. Something has to be done. History will favor us in 100 years. 
2020-09-06 13:22:00,Punisher95,We need to pinpoint and start nightly raids on these guys Full blackout Wear black everything If we look like them and get in their group we can split a whole bunch of people up Targeting the press would be no issue 
2020-09-06 13:22:00,Mark Melchi,We have had a successful operation out here in Colorado. So far 6 major Antifa leaders are no longer playing fantasy ninjas here. 
2020-09-06 13:22:00,Punisher95,And no offense to anyone in particular but I'm done waiting I'm done sitting here standing idly by well innocent Americans and police officers get injured every night I cannot just watch this and do nothing 
2020-09-06 13:22:00,Mark Melchi,I'm sure it's coming soon. We just need to be smart and get the right support from all leaders and groups 
2020-09-06 13:42:00,Punisher95,There was a quote in the movie Patriot where a woman tells Mel Gibson's character you have nothing for which you should be ashamed and his reply was I have done nothing and for that I am ashamed 
2020-09-06 13:42:00,Trent -Medford,Punisher 95 Pm your number please 
2020-09-06 13:53:00,13F1P,"@Mark Melchi , couldnt agree more. Even when our intent is to end them we will be more effective if we are coordinated and organized. "
2020-09-06 13:53:00,Nate,Exactly. Coordinated element of surprise and flank these fools. Fast and efficient. 
2020-09-06 13:53:00,D,"As I've said before, antifa and blm are increasing in size and tactics because they are well funded, and better organized. The only reason they are better organized is because they have a plethora of obedient minions. They will follow the lemmings off the cliff. Our issue, currently, is we have free thinkers with excellent ideas and options, yet no collusion. This group is making excellent strides in fixing those issues by appointing the initial leadership to get things in motion. In the past I have absolutely refused to join any group with the intention to rally for attention. Times have changed and the rallies are turning into security details to be allowed to speak in a fascist environment. We...may become the patriotic antifa. I have just wanted to live and let live but recently I am being pushed to go along with a group or be assaulted or restricted from being free. There are a lot of us out there. The ones that just want be be invisible. But ....we are being forced to leave the shadows. "
2020-09-06 13:53:00,Punisher95,There will come a day when all good men will have to do bad things

2020-09-06 13:53:00,Nate,They've thrown several first punches. We're running out of cheeks... 
2020-09-06 13:53:00,Country Girl,Agree 
2020-09-06 14:10:00,D,"I remember singing as a child in vacation bible school the song ""ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS, marching as to war. With the cross of Jesus, going on before""  I remember thinking "" are we going to have to fight a war as Christians??"" Enter 2020. "
2020-09-06 14:16:00,Punisher95,Enter soapbox..... I have been reading and watching a lot of people post videos take pictures screenshots and go about saying how they back the blue how they are patriots when is the time that actions speak louder than words people need to understand that if it's not us then who will stand because if we do not stand did I feel and I know that this will happen later but only be ten times worse so again I asked who will stand shoulder-to-shoulder who will stand shield to shield against this infectious disease They are a lot of people saying that they are Patriots but don't want to come out and join the rallies when is the correct time to where actions speak louder than words For me that time is now and I am done waiting 
2020-09-06 14:16:00,Dan-Medford,My turn for soapbox! 
2020-09-06 14:16:00,Punisher95,Please 
2020-09-06 14:16:00,D,"@Punisher95 ... i hear what you are saying. Please understand that just because those who have yet to join a rally or fly a flag of discontent, doesn't mean we won't when it warrants our participation. "
2020-09-06 14:19:00,Dan-Medford,"I get where everyone is. Im right there with you all. My best friend didn't come home from overseas, and it hurts me every day. His sacrifice (and all of the sacrifices of my brothers and sisters have made for this country) is getting pissed on by these communist rats. I'm done with it. But.... We need to play this smart. Retribution is coming to those people. Very very soon "
2020-09-06 14:19:00,Dan-Medford,"I promise, we're all right there with you @Punisher95 . Its coming. We just have to think about their tactics. We go full aggressive, its not just us they go after Its our families, our friends. They are the ones we fight to protect. We can't meet these punks head on until we're properly coordinated, equipped, and have a plan. Which is in the works. If we go at them half cocked, sure we'll kick their butts, but then they retaliate like rats. Run away, the sue our families, attack our livelihoods, and then move to being a thorn in our every day life. "

2020-09-06 17:08:00,Chris Tough,"So I usually don‚Äôt soap box on here. Most everyone in here I have stood shoulder to shoulder with at some point or another. Trent, Dan and myself have put a great amount of work in so when we do engage we will be successful. As of right now I‚Äôve raised enough money to get us 16 gas masks. There is other planning and communication with other groups that has to happen, we must be smart, we must be tactful how we proceed. Everyone here has taken risk by being on the front lines. I‚Äôd love to go get a few sticks of dynamite and head to Portland. While I was out of town working two men tried to break into my home, they came back two days later in broad daylight. My wife was smart and handled it very well. From how she did described them I believe them to be local antifa. We also had a man taking photos of our home the week before this happened. I would love to go out a catch those two fucks, believe me I tried. At this point my anger has cooled and knowing what and how we are proceeding gives me comfort. Pleas be patient and know that the leads in this group are working as hard as everyone else to bring this to fruition. "

2020-09-08 00:11:00,Joseph Weikel,Y‚Äôall should turn on your sprinklers outside to prevent embers and hot ash from the sky to set fire near you. and fill up you tubs with water so you have water to flush. Power grid. Is probably gonna get shut down if this keeps up. 
2020-09-08 00:56:00,Joseph Weikel,Also not a bad idea to fuel up everything you have and have reserves for generators. Gas is gonna get very expensive if power goes down.

Greenhouse destroyed but all else is good. Feeling blessed. Wish wind would die down. Worry about firefighters when it's so multi directional and gusty. Praying everyone else is okay!

2020-09-08 21:37:00,Iron Wolf 9,"Gion festival, Kyoto, Japan, 1864  Insurrectionist intent on overthrowing the sitting government hatched a plan of confusion and subversion that involved the setting of a series of uncontrollable fires that would not only cause destruction , but drain resources and distract from their actions.  Opposing the insurrectionists stood the Shinsengumi volunteer patriotic corps.  Known as the Shoguns last Samurai corps, they were the strongest group of swordsmen in Japanese history.  The plot was exposed and the enemies of patriotism and order crushed in a decisive clash of blades that left near 20 and the streets awash with blood in the newly risen sun.  Fast forward to 2020 . The names and place have changed but patriotism ALWAYS remains the same.  Stay vigilant.  Patriots Up. "

2020-09-09 08:32:00,Avatar,"Shelb So when we went yesterday to get our mustang (thanks Ken), noticed 5 vehicles with folks that made me suspicious. Young, masked, and black girl in one of them. My thought was, starting fires ans then ransacking evacuated homes. We started packing early Tues morning 0200, power had been out since 2200. Daughter and animals are all upset. Rough night with high winds and branches and trees falling. Noticed how portland wasn't as affected by fires ü§¨üò° My service dog wouldn't leave my side she knew something was up. I have lung issues from Iraq, got really sick last night and ongoing migraine. Stay safe everyone. We all want a end to these evil brainwashed domestic terrorists. Son said WY had snow too. "
2020-09-09 08:36:00,13F1P,"@Iron Wolf 9 , reading your post regarding the diversionary tactics of fire setting to drain and redirect resources reminds me of the balloon bombs of the Japanese. They sent incendiary bombs by ballon from Japan to cause large scale fires on the west coast in an effort to redirect and drain resorses. In fact the only fatalities from that war were right here in Oregon, caused when a church group, kids, found one of the bombs. "

She states that they are looking to the side of caution, and that we could move to a level 1 after this meeting. She also stated that it is not a bad idea to gather important papers, valuables and pets. "

Woke up to a phone call from Melissa Connole Kelly stating the fire crews had to retreat due to dangerous conditions and I needed to leave. Drove around to look at the area and look for visible fire, non found. As I‚Äôm locking my gate up a sheriff stops to check on me and we talked for a while. What I heard him tell me was mind blowing. He literally said they are finding staging areas with explosives, petrochemicals and wine bottles filled with gasoline. Not just randomly but all over our area. He told me these fires are not behaving in ways normal fires grow, they start in odd locations all within feet of roadways or pathways. "

2020-09-10 20:16:00,Todd,Always making excuses and never taking responsibility 
2020-09-10 20:16:00,Erik,"@D Thats is exactly what I was saying the other day. She built a tender box here in Oregon because of mismanagement, it sets off and now she pushing climate control. They have been pushing climate contro bullshit l since the 70's "
2020-09-10 20:16:00,D,"@Erik don't forget , she is also a fortune teller as she predicted a wild fire season unlike any we have seen in the past..that was what , three months ago during the whole timber unity ""uprising"" "
2020-09-10 20:16:00,Kahrheart,You can sure see the guy standing at the back and the red of the gas can behind that red truck. 
2020-09-10 20:32:00,D,"I also question this fire fighter pull out. They were ordered to retreat. I would live to talk to a firefighter directly to see how they felt about the withdrawal. Kate brown said at least 5 times this morning that the first responders only mission right now is to save lives... you have to let it burn to get your point across.. see, climate change wiped out Oregon.. "
2020-09-10 20:32:00,Iron Wolf 9,Latest intel from Clackamas County Fire is that the Fire Fighters did not retreat they withdrew to reposition and reassess. Word from the ground is they are back at it in the contested Estecada area.  
2020-09-10 20:32:00,D,That makes perfect sense. 
2020-09-10 20:51:00,T.Durden,I saw them regroup at the high school. And saw their reinforcements heading back in.

2020-09-10 22:00:00,Kahrheart,"Hey All, we The People has confirmed that BLM and Antifa are taking over the evac site at Silke Field in Springfield. Tre posted in his page that the Red Cross was doing a terrible job and announce that the ‚ÄúBOOP Cross is taking over‚Äù. "
2020-09-10 22:00:00,Patriot Coalition,"We only go off of what our intel confirms- sorry Ok- bear with me- a lot of new people- so here comes the copy and paste of the ‚ÄúRules/Guidelines‚Äù ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è There are a few things that I believe need to be addressed. So please bare with me. ** There is a lot of new people joining our group. Everyone needs to be aware that each person we add have been through a vetting process, a process that hasn‚Äôt let us down yet. We have very dedicated mods who take this task very seriously and who are absolutely amazing! So please give a shout out to our mods and thank them - they keep us safe. ** Belonging to this group there is certain expectations we have for each and everyone of you. 1st- our group name and members stay out of any conversations with people or groups. Other groups do not vet like we do and have had people get into their groups because of this. So PLEASE do not talk about what we talk about or what we are planning with ANY other group. Our leaders do communicate with other group leaders and we do work with them. 2nd- If we find out that information is being leaked out to others or other groups ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY WARNING. You will be removed from our group immediately. 3rd-Do NOT share information as to rallys or needing people to show here or there. This causes chaos amongst everyone and makes our phones light up like a Christmas tree. If there is any sort of intel or information you have please message one of us personally- we will then give it to our intel team to dig into and verify. 4th- We believe that anyone who wants to be a patriot can be- from being a prayer warrior to bring boots on the ground- we do not turn anyone away, unless they can not be vetted of course. 5th- Just because you invited people to the group does not mean they get an automatic pass- so please do not send us a message stating you invited so n so and you vouch for them. If you think about it, how many of you would know me from Adam on the street? How many know if I‚Äôm male or female? Do you see where I am going here? ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è I have met a lot of you, but you haven‚Äôt even realized it. 6th- Here is our heads/leads- and if they say something you can bet it has been ran past all of us and they need to be respected. Trent aka Spartan, Dan aka Bravo91, Chris Tough, Joe W, John aka JH, Pat aka John Elway. 7th- Do not post your personal address or phone numbers- PM the person you are wanting to give this information to. 8th- When we are called out as a group- PLEASE PLEASE mask up- hide your identity. 9th- We will never stop you or say you can not go to any events or rally‚Äôs/flag waves, we are not her to dictate, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we will not worry about you. We also will never say you can not be part of other groups as well... but we ARE saying that what is said in here is NOT to be told to other groups. ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è 11th- Please do not post stating that you could use some help at events or up coming events to the entire group- please pass that along to us- we may have something in the works and getting ready to release it to the group. 12th- We do have fun- we do joke around and we do chatter a lot. What we are doing is important- we do wish we could go to each and every event, but sometimes our prescience makes things worse. We are not a group that wants to stir the pot or cause trouble but we are a group that will go in to help stop an issue before it starts. Ok- now back to what you were doing. Lmao "

I am heading down there as well so we have a lead there...  If you chose to go there as well- rule is- you check in with me- do NOT kit up- do NOT open carry and DO NOT let our political views get in the way of what the volunteers are doing - no matter what side of the political side they are on- it is NOT the time or the place.  See you soon 
2020-09-10 22:39:00,Dan-Medford,"The whole damn state is in crisis right now. People are scared, tensions are high, and there's a lot of unknowns.

A special thank you to the members of leadership who have been actively engaged in not only the days activities but the narratives that will engage our activities as well.  It is imperative that we STAY THE COURSE and continue living out the Coalition message, that being selfless service of our Faith , Family, Community and Country  Regardless of how our fellow American identifies we will support and defend them despite personal cost unless they , by their own choice, position themselves our enemies.  Then we crush them.  Otherwise, we must and shall work with them for the benefit of those who may be suffering. Community first, we can argue later.  Patriots Up .  See you out there. "

2020-09-11 09:22:00,Jake,"I don't post much here. These reports haven't been vetted by the coalition intel team. Here's my oregon city local intel.  Mulino golf course posted on facebook that they caught people trying to light maltovs on the course last night some time.  According to clackamas scanners and a fellow patriot of mine, active looters in estacada and molalla.  The same patriot has a friend who's dad killed two terrorist setting a fire on his land in redland. Cops arrived and took the bodies.  The same patriot informed me that his police app is showing ccom labeling calls as terrorism. (Screenshot attached)  A family in Mulino was told by police to kill anyone trying to set fires.  It's 9/11 folks. Some of us don't fucking forget and will never forgive. "

At Springfield High where everyone is out- the REASON why nothing Patriotic is to be worn is because politician stance needs to be left at the street. There is BLM and BU and possibly Antifa evacuates there and or helping. The guy running it is a Patriot and he doesn‚Äôt like them there either, BUT it is a safe zone for EVERYONE. There has been 3 ‚ÄúPatriot‚Äù groups down there raising hell and causing issues. I know exactly who they are and it‚Äôs typical. They have been there since the beginning yelling and cussing out people and it has A LOT of people on edge who just want a safe place not a war zone. I went down last night and told him that if they need us there and to be professional and not stir the pot and to run security to call me. Even though he is a Patriot himself he had to really get after them to shut them up. "
2020-09-11 10:20:00,Punisher95,That's frustrating

"
2020-09-11 10:20:00,Punisher95,Agreed 
2020-09-11 10:20:00,Patriot Coalition,We need to continue what we are doing by patrolling our areas and if I get a call that they need help we will need people to respond. We will be neutral and help them keep EVERYONE safe with cool heads and leave our beliefs at the door

2020-09-11 10:20:00,Chris Tough,If this is a safe space for everyone then that‚Äôs needs to be respected. I can just guess who‚Äôs load mouth was there being a fucking idiot. This is why we as the coalition have to be smart in everything we do! I‚Äôve said it a hundred times and I‚Äôll say it a hundred more. OUR EGOS DO NOT BELONG AT THE TABLE OF PATRIOTISM! These people are all ego and bluster. Real patriots are out helping those in our community get up from the ashes of loss and ruin. This is a time we should be coming together.

2020-09-11 10:38:00,Dan-Medford,"1) NO STARTING SHIT WITH BLM, BU, ETC. We all need to work together to help out fellow Oregonians. If I catch wind of anyone in the Coalition harrassing/starting shit you will be removed from this Coalition. Period. No ifs, ands or buts. Picking fights and being confrontational gives us a bad rap I repeat: IF ANY LEADS HEAR OF MEMBERS STARTING SHIT YOU ARE REMOVED AND NO LONGER WITH THIS COALITION. If you are threatened and have to defend yourself, that's fine. Don't start anything, but defend if attacked "
2020-09-11 10:38:00,Dan-Medford,"2) help any groups with evac/donations if you can. 3) lets fact check our info before posting it. Too much false info is flying around right now. Example: we had patriots being followed by other patriots thinking they're Ants looking for trouble. Lack of communication and bad intel was a major factor in this 4) if you're out and about helping, don't be in full kit. Keep it close, but people are already freaked out. Seeing a group rolling up in full battle rattle doesn't ease tension 5) STAY SAFE DAMNIT Ok. Rant over I hate being a ""hard ass"" but it has to be done "
2020-09-11 10:38:00,Jake,Where does intel get sent

2020-09-11 10:49:00,Trent -Medford,And a statue in Oregon far as vandalism theft or arson unless you are in danger or Human danger life-threatening you cannot draw a gun unless you are in life threatening dangerÔøº 
2020-09-11 10:49:00,D,I dont agree with any of those suggestions however I am not one to advise on the handling of any situation. I have learned over the years that you can plan to do things all you want but when its go time your reaction determines the outcome. Under these conditions arson is considered attempted mass murder in my eye. 
2020-09-11 10:49:00,Sam O,Does anyone here live near Turner?

2020-09-11 10:49:00,Sam O,"One of our guys was saying a firefighter was talking to OSP and the trooper mentioned that they believe that there is some coordinated arson, and they believe that the next fire might start off 22, south salem, or west salem. There's an ass load of trees next to Enchanted forest, and salem hills to the south. Perfect place to start another fire, and Parrish Gap is a good access point "
2020-09-11 10:49:00,Iron Wolf 9,"While I understand and agree with the statute that has been going around concerning acceptable handling of suspected arsonists up to and including lethal force please remember that in alll situations where force must be applied , this isnt the movies, you WILL be arrested and the onus of proof and evidence will be upon you.  When confronted with any situatiom act in accordance with your own judgement but remember the repercussions that come after the moment of action.  And please, as there has been considerable levels of misplaced suspicion bordering upon harassment and aggression fuelled by heightened tensions and shot through nerves , it is of paramount importance to remember that every goth kid you see with a lighter isnt necessarily an arsonist, it is entirely possible they really are just lighting a cigarette. "
2020-09-11 10:49:00,Sam O,"I'll probably start driving a loop on Parrish Gap/winter creek road/Enchanted way. I have a 300mm lens on my camera, so I can video from a distance "

2020-09-11 13:51:00,Punisher95,Social media and Google are controlled both by the liberal parties anything against their views is erased my friend just deleted me out of his life because I told him about antifa and them setting the fires because he posted something about it being false

2020-09-11 13:51:00,Nate,I wholeheartedly believe Antifa is behind at least half of these fires. There's just been too many people with pics and stories and proof... It makes me sick.

2020-09-11 13:56:00,Iron Wolf 9,"I would be careful about sharing and taking seriously posts such as the ones above. Antifa are misguided, they are wrong, but , as they have proven , they are faaar from stupid , therefore anything that you see that amounts to admittance of their malevolence are wholly false.  Remember their M.O. is denial and their official stance is that there is no such thing as Antifa.  Be smart with what we are sharing as we cannot afford errors of judgement as patriots get needlessly riled up over social media troll posts. "

2020-09-11 14:19:00,Chris Tough,Ted Wheeler and Kate brown should have thousands of us standing outside their fucking houses 
2020-09-11 14:41:00,Sam O,"A lot of people went from being pissed that Kate Brown was sending police to Lindsay's shop, to defending the police wholeheartedly. Everyone is on different levels of support for the police, but it was just a weird switch Patriot Coalition added Miss Mouthy to the group. "

2020-09-11 15:19:00,D,Here comes inslee with his climate changing fire starting narrative 
2020-09-11 15:19:00,Iron Wolf 9,"On a day that many of us planned to rally at the Capitol in memory of those citizens, soldiers and first responders who lost their lives , Patriots across the Pacific Northwest are living our ideals in real time, offering their time, equipment, money , resources and labor to assist their communities impacted by the unprecedent wild fires ravaging the land.  They do this knowing not the politics, religion, culture, creed , race or otherwise of those whose property they protect in full kit from looters, whose families they evacuate and shelter, whose children they console and feed,or whose livestock they wrangle and move. Today they know only that they are their neighbors.  Today they know they are Americans, and that is enough.  Perhaps tomorrow we will argue again. Maybe tomorrow we will be divided. Maybe this experiment we call America will fail and it will all fade away..  Maybe.  Or maybe we will understand that what we can share is of far more value than what we cannot, and that "

2020-09-11 17:49:00,Kahrheart,"I drove Hwy 36 today, in through Eugene and out to check out the Springfield donation site at my alma mater;) Stopped by Alderwood Park and drove through as we have been having anarchy symbols painted on the log and trees and bathrooms.  All was quiet. Driving into Springfield was like entering the apocalypse. Just surreal.  I saw lots of non-evacuated looking people there grabbing suitcases and filling them up with donations and steady streams of cars entering from all directions.  I did see a huge red, white & blue sign that said Patriot Rescue‚Äù. It was an animal rescue and the ladies at the booth seemed to be coordinating rescues of animals in evacuated areas. I also saw a few people walking around with Patriotic masks on as well.  I didn‚Äôt want to get in the way, so I stayed at a distance and watched. Such a show of pure American grit. ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏  Drove back home up Hwy 36 and all was well. "
2020-09-11 17:49:00,T.Durden,I just drove way up Hillock Burn and went the back side to kinzy and back down into Estacada. Saw some smoking hot spots but looks like the fire is well under control to me. There were people deep in the burn zone checking out their houses.

2020-09-11 18:10:00,13F1P,"Okay, we just got over the hill, hwy58, lots of smoke. The ride was clear of suspicious activity. We'll be to the cabin soon. When all this slows down id like to invite my Patriot family up to relax. Were a little redneck but its home. "

Putting focus here not only because it is local , but because it is flanked by the river on one side and bisected by I-5 on the other.

2020-09-12 09:54:00,13F1P,@Bill anything new on you suspicious folk in Albany? 
2020-09-12 09:54:00,Sunshine,"@13F1P no, we lost them. We're back at the house, listening to scanner. I have a video i will post in 5 "
2020-09-12 10:03:00,Avatar,"13F1P @Bill good work Patriot! @JW Central Oregon anything new in your area?  I think we, Proud Patriots, have made a difference. Keep your knee at their necks!  Proud to be an American! "
2020-09-12 10:11:00,Bill,Can't get video to load heres a screen shot from it...chk ants back pack looks like an unbrella 
2020-09-12 10:14:00,Sunshine,"@13F1P thanks, we def made them nervous. Three split off from the guy with the tan pack...three went down waverly and the other up grand prairie. Lost all 4. Have caught on the scanner 3 scans mentioning fire but nothing major as of now. 10:11 now. "
2020-09-12 10:44:00,Avatar,"13F1P I would say you might be right, or the end of a fire work. Definitely suspicious! F$@#ing ants....... "
2020-09-12 10:44:00,Country Girl,My husband and I are going to go drive around Brownsville Timber and out by crawfordsville.

2020-09-12 12:23:00,Tony,"‚ÄòEvidently‚Äô the deputy was put on leave~ Hey punisher, I do not know just what militia he was speaking to.. "
2020-09-12 12:23:00,Punisher95,There was another video similar to that it was with a policeman I think it was the same guy the policeman said it was probably antifa 
2020-09-12 12:23:00,13F1P,"We just drove down 97 to the area looking over the 242 fire. Talked with a local Sheriff. He agreed that ants are responsible for the arson statewide and glad to know there are good people watching. Forest service we ran in to, same sentiment. "
2020-09-12 12:23:00,Tony,Wow! I missed that!üò≥ 
2020-09-12 12:23:00,Punisher95,Thanks on the confirmation And this is what happens when the media gets a hold of true information they snuff it out

2020-09-12 12:47:00,Debbie,Hey guys I can drive around Albany area in a bit. Those kids are too close to my place! Any place you need me to go? 
2020-09-12 12:58:00,Debbie,I talked to Patriot Coalition the other night about driving around. I vet the people. Thought I'd see if there is a need. 
2020-09-12 12:58:00,Sunshine,"@Debbie ive been out a few times but havent seen anyone. Im thinking they were either dropping stuff off by the fields or the ind. park behind home depot. OR could they be coming back from last nights riots...not the umbrella.....possibly ditch their bikes in the bushes somewhere and hitch a ride into town. We saw them stopped at the little parking spot by the bridge and started riding west on grand prairie over the bridge. We zipped past n waited for them to pass the churches. The one kept on going up Grand Prairie the other three crossed the road when we started coming again, took the time to stop n flip us off and then we went around and caught them coming up waverly towards 21st and by the time we could turn around they were gone. Sent a friend down the bike paths, nothing. Covered the streets pretty good for an hour or so no luck. *""note"" the umbrella "
2020-09-12 13:06:00,Patriot Coalition,We are looking for parts to fix our truck from earlier this week... we have got to get it fixed- having one car absolutely sucks!!!  Once we get some of our personal stuff done we can meet up with some peeps here in Albany and then come up with a plan to go scouting so we are not all covering the same spots at the same time.... if anyone wants to help- let me know- we can meet at our house 
2020-09-12 13:06:00,Patriot Coalition,This just came through from one of my friends 
2020-09-12 13:13:00,Debbie,Sunshine Im past 29th out by the bowling alley so I can keep eye out.

2020-09-12 13:13:00,Russ -Redmond,I'm currently out picking up supplies for evacuated animals and their people. Let me know if you know of someone in need please 
2020-09-12 13:13:00,Shelb,Possibly hooking up with another to keep watch east of salem/silverton Helped this morning in taking care of the cats and dogs 
2020-09-12 13:13:00,Patriot Coalition,@Sunshine I believe so That‚Äôs the only bridge I can think of on that road 
2020-09-12 13:51:00,JW Central Oregon,@Patriot Coalition Nothing new yet besides the fire affecting you guys is getting close to madras 
2020-09-12 13:51:00,David,Transported Dottie from Thurston up north. Delivered supplies to Salem along the drive Stopped to assist a Veteran struggling to breathe at a damn BUS STOP. Do we have a contact to check on our Veterans?? That protruding umbrella is VERY suspicious activity especially on a BIKE! Who rides a BIKE at a time like this? I'm out of commission for the rest of the day. OVER 
2020-09-12 13:51:00,Debbie,No plate on the back of the BMW at fred meyer albany Front plate is yellow like paper and crooked. Couldnt get info

2020-09-12 14:43:00,Patriot Coalition,@Sunshine Did you call it in 
2020-09-12 14:43:00,Sunshine,"Ok, went down springhill, found 3 construction bags on side of road seperated one on one side and two on other, turned right onto independence found 3 more within a mile or two. Could they be fuel? Im wondering if theyre placed there on purpose. We couldnt pick them up no room in our car... They already know, we heard it on the scanner ^that was for PC "
2020-09-12 14:59:00,Sarah Stahl,I got a request for some more security at Silky Fields over night.

2020-09-12 14:59:00,Sarah Stahl,Christine is her name. If Jimmy is running it I'd double check but I was just told by my friend Brenda who's been down there daily that Noc shift security was needed. Passing on the request.

2020-09-12 16:06:00,Tony,Thank you. 
2020-09-12 16:06:00,Michelle R,Do you have details on the cars parked on Pleasant Valley Rd? I've got a friend down there that can check it out. 
2020-09-12 16:06:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,@Michelle R That is an old report so they‚Äôd be long gone. I had someone check earlier. Nothing found.

I called cops immediately! Apparently this truck has been chased around few areas where there just happen to be fires after... seen this truck anywhere??? She is in handcuffs but the guy is not as of yet We are LOCKED AND LOADED and WILL NOT LEAVE our property again This was in Sweet Home "

2020-09-12 18:04:00,Shelb,Does anyone know what the deal with the yellow tape on mailboxes is and who is putting it there? 
2020-09-12 18:04:00,Shelb,"@T.Durden Democrats made the mistake of letting their little slow fire burn, believing they were in control. Feeding it and being ignorant fools to the growing windstorm forming around it. Well their fire grew, and is now out of their control trying to destroy whatever is in its path. It needs a quick full fledged drenching to bring a end. No I'm not talking of all the current firesü§® "

2020-09-12 18:04:00,Avatar,Michelle R Which parking lot? I‚Äôll go over and strike up a conversation with him. 
2020-09-12 18:30:00,David,"Patriots: When you are patrolling keep an eye out for flammables near the road that may or may not have been placed there intentionally. I have been notified from a trusted source there have been furniture, objects, and whatnots ""found"" a long side or in the middle of the road. Tomorrow we will scout and REMOVE such objects placed intentionally or unintentional in order to prevent more fires. "
2020-09-12 18:41:00,Patriot Coalition,@Shelb The yellow tape aka caution ribbon is to show they have been evacuated

2020-09-12 22:20:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"I just had a couple ideas. @Patriot Coalition , that if we get flagging tape. I‚Äôll say orange, that you put a small loop on the CB antenna, radio antenna, drivers side mirror. Most of us don‚Äôt know who the other is, but if it‚Äôs between us, on how we identify rigs then that will surely cut down on false chases. They could be a good guy, we know that, but if it‚Äôs kept to only this group, we could I‚Äôd each other without running a big target flag. Just look for orange flagging tape on antennas, mirrors. Thoughts Moma Bear? We did similar back in the Virginia march on the capital. Tied around left bicep. Different colors of flagging to show which company you were in. "
2020-09-12 22:20:00,Tony,"Good thunkin‚Äô JD, as long as those damn ants don‚Äôt figger it out. ü§® At that point it would make us targets.. "
2020-09-12 22:20:00,John H,"We'd need to change up colors and locations, but it could certainly work. "
2020-09-12 22:20:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,Could easily call for a different color any day 
2020-09-12 22:20:00,David,GOOD IDEA! 
2020-09-12 22:20:00,D,"Challenge and password. Thats the only way to stay incognito. Itll have to change every day. But in order to do that, everyone has to make contact "
2020-09-12 22:20:00,Sawyer,"C&PW could go out on the ""red"" daily...just a thought. "
2020-09-12 22:37:00,Patriot Coalition,Love the idea JD!!! 
2020-09-12 22:37:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"Flagging tape is pretty cheep. We gab all share where we meet someone. Maybe start off with 2 colors and moms Bear calls a color in the am. Not need to change everyday, but the option is there. Does away with friendly fire in group, and less stress on confrontation if someone isn‚Äôt flying colors. "
2020-09-12 22:37:00,Patriot Coalition,I say - who ever goes out first calls the color- if I‚Äôm working or sleeping from working- you have no color- I don‚Äôt need that kind of responsibility ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Lmao

2020-09-12 23:25:00,Patriot Coalition,@Dan-Medford - yet 
2020-09-13 00:00:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"So since this is my idea, I‚Äôll take charge for now.  Get 2 rolls of flagging tape. Our fight with each other would be Beavers, or ducks. We all know that orange for beavers is #1. And who doesn‚Äôt like the look, taste, or smell of a beaver. They make damn good chilli üòÇ  Then we have green for ducks. They are fun to hunt with a shotgun. Make perty good jerky. Or, if you find a woman that leans that way.......well let‚Äôs just say my ex was a duck. So fuck a duck.  If you are offended, take it up with Bob at your local Walmart.  2 official colors. Orange and green. Will take a few days for everyone to catch up I‚Äôm sure. So start with orange. Just a small loop around the FB, ham, radio antenna. Share colors with those in the group as a foot will go a long way. Do not trail the color for a foot. Tie a small piece that‚Äôs visible. Then we can id the other. I‚Äôm open to idea but share, and 2 colors for now. "

2020-09-13 10:57:00,Patriot Coalition,Yeah let‚Äôs keep things proven- ie: you guys actually saw it or actually was posted by a law enforcement site or like here in my area there is a group that does nothing but listens to scanners and posts what is coming across- I have been seeing on Ants sites that they are finding it funny Patriots are driving all over the countryside to false sightings- so I‚Äôm figuring they are putting a lot of false info out just to keep us all running 
2020-09-13 10:57:00,Tony,Copy. I get it. 
2020-09-13 10:57:00,D,But...on the positive side...those turd stains are aware we are patrolling. Keep kicking the sleeping dog. They can laugh all the way to the grave. 
2020-09-13 10:57:00,Patriot Coalition,I just don‚Äôt want Patriots playing their little games or getting sucked into their stupid ass games- they are posting that while Patriots are out chasing ghosts- THEY are actually at the evac camps helping people... it‚Äôs stupid and typical for them Exactly 
2020-09-13 10:57:00,T.Durden,Patriots are helping evac livestock and families. We need some of those stories going out. They are just at the camps for photo ops and publicity. We never look for any publicity because we don't want or need it. And I think that is a mistake. That's how they control the narrative. Police scanner White tacoma 4 door 2 males. Gas cans in the back. Near Unger RD West bound on Unger Rd Near 211 
2020-09-13 10:57:00,D,I believe these calls about gas cans.. are either false or diversions...or can they really be that dumb? 
2020-09-13 10:57:00,Patriot Coalition,Who wanted the video from the 22nd of the kid in the white T-shirt shooting at our guys? I found it again and screen recorded it for you 
2020-09-13 10:57:00,T.Durden,This is the scanner. Info is from a cop that saw the truck. Not a call in. Truck saw the cop and flipped around and took off. 
2020-09-13 10:57:00,D,Do you think they are that dumb or..maybe bait to draw the LEO out of the area to do other stuff? 
2020-09-13 10:57:00,Sunshine,Scio opened up a crime watchers page on fb. They're posting pics of people n their rigs that will be keeping watch overniight. Thinking thats a great idea and good info for us so we know when we're patrolling who else is out therr with us.

2020-09-14 14:05:00,Shelb,"@Ale F OK so catch me up on that guy on the code red guy. Because we have ran into him too in Silverton. Is he good guy or bad? His name, if same one, I believe is Brad Morrison "
2020-09-14 14:05:00,Ewok,"My 2 cents of guy in question: seems calm every time I've seen him, he was trying to keep Geena away for terrorist in Salem last Monday. I thought he was hanging with Alejandro a lot in Salem, he might be a good source of info. "
2020-09-14 14:05:00,Shelb,"He lives in Woodburn, not part of any patriot group, but a group of minuteman militia I believe is how he put it. He has been to events in Salem I don't believe he is blm Antifa. He does patrolling North of Silverton on up to Estacada "
2020-09-14 14:05:00,Ale F,I don't think he's bad either I just got that info and wanted to see if you guys got the same 
2020-09-14 14:11:00,Avatar,Jay Thomas I know him. He is definitely not BLM/Antifa 
2020-09-14 14:11:00,Shelb,"He is pretty vocal against antifa blm and page is public, so they are probably trying to turn patriots against him "
2020-09-14 15:09:00,Ale F,Ok figured just wanted to make sure cuz I received that today and didn't Wana risk any thing 
2020-09-14 15:09:00,David,ARE WE STILL LOOKING FOR THE NISSAN 
2020-09-14 15:15:00,DeeDee,I think it's another Antifa ploy to have Patriots turn on each other. There has been a lot of Patriots joining together to help during recent crisis..do they are bound to shift tactics again to divide us

Start with justice on our DA and then move on to the Governor. Maybe by the time we get to the first judge, they will have changed their tunes I'm pretty sure that the second amendment was written so we the people could hold our elected officials to account for their wrong doing.

2020-09-15 06:55:00,Jeffro,We need to have a meeting! Need to know where we are headed as a group and get to know our leadership. Not a good time to start bailing out. 
2020-09-15 07:51:00,Tony,Is there going to be any information given today? 
2020-09-15 07:51:00,Whitebear,I have been with this group since it began as a nation wide organization. I have watched good people join and good people leave. At this point I need some reassurance that the group is fully organized and on track with the original goal. 
2020-09-15 07:51:00,Jeffro,üëç 
2020-09-15 07:51:00,Bravo91,Leadership is getting things figured out today and will get y'all filled in this evening.

2020-09-15 09:43:00,T.Durden,Brief explanation of those pictures and a few other things for those who didn't follow all the different stories.  https://youtu.be/nuuMKOVhzD0 
2020-09-15 09:43:00,Shelb,"So the young kid I alerted the security at fairgrounds about [and got them to tighten security at fairgrounds] and called the Sheriff on, with the black truck with no tags...just got arrested starting fires along I5. "
2020-09-15 16:20:00,T.Durden,Same thing.  https://youtu.be/Io-o3OcyRHc 
2020-09-15 16:26:00,Ewok,"Just speaking for me, but for people to leave the group before our leaders share new plans seems over reacting and doesn't help the rest of us sticking around. Please wait to leave till leadership speaks. "
2020-09-15 16:37:00,D,"Stepping down vs complete removal proves there was a disagreement to the direction of this group. I haven't been around long enough to know of a direction issue, but there apparently was one. So now the new leadership should be completely clear on what this organization will be, going forward ..then stay on that path. That way, if we decide to stay, we all will be in agreement of how we want this to go. I, too almost left...any time there is a shift in leadership the organization is vulnerable. I will tell you, that last rally at the capital had me heading for the door. "
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Ewok,@D Sent you a PM 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Punisher95,Soo what's is the plan 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,D,"We have to wait till this evening, I guess. @Punisher95 "
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Punisher95,Ok 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,D,"No doubt, either the action has completely shut down or another group has been formed.. and we were left behind. "
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Bravo91,@D neither is the case. We're still waiting on all the leadership to get off work and other daily things so we can talk. 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,D,Then why has the chatter completely shut down? 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Bravo91,That is something I do not know. 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Sam O,Work is for losers. 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Trent -Medford,I didn‚Äôt shut it down 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Bravo91,"Well I already knew I was a loser, don't rub it in @Sam O lol "
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Sam O,I just got done with work. Lol 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Bravo91,LOSER 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Sam O,I'm so sick of computer related issues.. 3 hours over a damn driver. 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Sawyer,Level 4 shutdown in the woods... No work till it rains. 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,D,I'm on vacation 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Todd,I think it‚Äôs because people are waiting to hear from the leaders this evening. I think if we are patient and remember the mission we can get back on task soon. 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Sawyer,Yup. @Todd has it right. 
2020-09-15 16:38:00,Dub,My two cents. Everyone needs to relax and let Trent and Dan explain what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs not going to do any good yo worry about it To worry about it that is 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,D,Very well.. we will wait. 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Dee,I'm working..but sneak peak phone when able. Chatter has probably slowed with the fire threat level. I'm sure leadership will enlighten us when they are able to discuss plans. 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Trent -Medford,Y we are talking everyone I want your input and thought what is the path of this group what is the goal need everyone to be honest 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Sawyer,"I would like to see the group on a more secure platform. I was told telegram isn't secure but there is a secure way to run it. Signal is also secured, end to end encrypted. "
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Country Girl,"I am a newer member, but I like that I can go to different events and meet like minded people and know That I have someone‚Äôs back just like they have mine. I love that we all let each other know what‚Äôs going on in our area and willing to help each other. "
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Todd,To uphold and defend our constitution. Fight for what‚Äôs right .... 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Bravo91,@Sawyer an example of how telegram isn't secured. Here's one of the Antifa chats. I can sit and read the convo without even joining the chat Telegram.me/pdxuprising What I'm wanting from our group is a team who works together to defend our communities and support it when it's hurting. 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,D,My opinion. I want to be a part of a group that leads by positive example. The leaders need a clear and concise vision for the coalition and how we want to be perceived with the general public. We can accomplish peace through superior firepower but in order to do that we need discipline. We need cohesion. We need to all be on the exact same sheet of music or this orchestra will sound horrible. 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Chris Tough,Structure. Communication across the board. Follow our leads. 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Todd,Monthly meetings? 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Bravo91,"I'll flat out be honest. I messaged the leads, saying I was disappointed in how patriots had been acting the past week with the fires. I felt that it seemed many were running around ""chasing ghosts"" and not helping the communities with the crisis going on. I let my emotions get the better of me, since my group in Southern Oregon had been busting ass helping where we could and I worded it in a harsh way. Which was my mistake. I understand what our patriots were doing, and appreciate it. But we were getting a lot of bad press (which we always do no matter what) and I flat out didn't like seeing the bad press So it was my mouth/thumbs that caused this strife. Simple as that. For that I apologize. I don't want to see us fall apart because of my input. I was just overwhelmed with all of the chatter of patrols, hunting arsonists, etc. Mike Self has left the group. "
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Chris Tough,"It was not just you @Bravo91 three of the leads in this group agreed that we did not agree with what was going on, or at least the way it was being done. "
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Dee,I was impressed with the level of participation with helping the community. I was with the 22nd crew and was pleased with the dedication..even if unprepared for tactics at the time. I think we're on the right track just need clear direction from leadership. 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,Bravo91,I recognize that the patriots doing that were being vigilant and I appreciate that. I was also just worried that the next report that was incoming was that a patriot had been shot/harmed 
2020-09-15 16:49:00,D,"Well.. sometimes tough love needs to be done. This isn't the mickey mouse club. Peoples lives are at risk at these events.. but we do absolutely need people to listen ... hear that?? LISTEN to the leads.. for fuksake. I am way out of the loop but I sat and watched an organized effort, quickly turn into a ckusterfuk because everyone went apeshit and didn't listen .. "
2020-09-15 16:49:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"Hmmmm. Well I can tell you Bravo91, that you obviously live in a different area than the ‚Äúghost‚Äù patrolling was going on. I have yet to see any negative press about ‚Äúthis group ‚Äú with the fires. Springfield....ya, but what would you expect. Linn County has been overwhelming attached by looters and firebugs. And we don‚Äôt need your permission or approval to protect our lives and property. I‚Äôll wait to be booted now that I have spoke my mind. "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Bravo91,"I understand we're all angry, and want these Ant asshats gone. But if we run around half cocked (im not saying we are or anyone has) then we fall into a mob mentality and wind up getting patriots hurt. "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,D,We need organized leadership. These leaders just simply need to be available to send and receive information/ orders. Those who are not leaders need to get over the title and feed the information to the leads so a informed decision can be made.. then passed back down to the foot soldiers. 
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Chris Tough,"@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county Lot of people were out there chasing other patriots that lived in the area, calling out info on others out there doing the same thing you were. "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,T.Durden,Fires were set within a mile or 2 of my house. I was helping evac animals for 2 days. Then I spent several nights patrolling and just being present to at least slow the fires. They are coming to my home town. People I grew up with are now homeless. 
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Sam O,"I'm a part of most of the community pages for all of the Cities heading towards Detroit Lake, and you wouldn't believe how many of those people were out there trying to chase people around, or were threatening to hang people. "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Bravo91,"@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county im not saying you need lead ""permission or approval"". If that what needs be done, then so be it. I just want us to be on the same page with it. And there's been plenty of press about it. Haven't you seen the news of ""armed militias setting up checkpoints""? Or the tweets from Multnomah County sheriff asking/pleading people to not do that? We're not law enforcement. "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,D,This is why we need regional leadership. Then those leaders talk to all of the leaders to decide a proper course of action 
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"I trust Trent and Dan wholeheartedly! They are very disciplined and informed, make informed decisions with consideration for those involved. I believe they will take this group in a very worthwhile direction. It takes the right people in the group as well. We need to be respectfully honest, disciplined, with egos in check, trust and respect for leadership. Common goals, with trusted members who do their part and an agreement from all to stay in bounds of the group mission. I think there are positive changes coming, so hold tight everyone! It's been tough to read the same repeated warnings regarding mission chatter, etc to adults. No one should need a babysitter. For many it's our future, our lives, our jobs, and possibility of not only prosecution of a member but every leader on the line. Above all, we need to consider everyone in the group with every action taken, every message written. BLM is fueled by inappropriate emotions, we have to be better than them, or it's all pointless. "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Sam O,Or shoot anybody with a gas can on site. I can tell you I carry 5 gallons in my vehicle at all times 
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Todd,At times people may not agree with the leaders but we must all follow the leaders direction or we fall apart. 
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Bravo91,@D complety agree 
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Sam O,It was entering BLM level of mob mentality 
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Todd,We have to stay disciplined and not fall victim to mob mentality 
2020-09-15 17:09:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"@Chris Tough Which is the reason to identify our rigs to others which a couple of admins, that were added by Patriot Co. didn‚Äôt like my idea and thought I was stepping out of my lane but PC didn‚Äôt think so which is another reason for the situation. "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"I trust Trent and Dan wholeheartedly! They are very disciplined and informed, make informed decisions with consideration for those involved. I believe they will take this group in a very worthwhile direction. It takes the right people in the group as well. We need to be respectfully honest, disciplined, with egos in check, trust and respect for leadership. Common goals, with trusted members who do their part and an agreement from all to stay in bounds of the group mission. I think there are positive changes coming, so hold tight everyone! It's been tough to read the same repeated warnings regarding mission chatter, etc to adults. No one should need a babysitter. For many it's our future, our lives, our jobs, and possibility of not only prosecution of a member but every leader on the line. Above all, we need to consider everyone in the group with every action taken, every message written. BLM is fueled by inappropriate emotions, we have to be better than them, or it's all pointless. "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Sam O,"There were so many posts that I had seen of people calling out other vehicles oh, and people had to post "" hey that green car is actually me, I live out there and was getting my stuff, please don't shoot me"" "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,@Bravo91 Was it this group up north with the checkpoints? Nope. I used this page to simply let other locals of Linn County know. 
2020-09-15 17:09:00,Alena,"I‚Äôm new as well and have yet to meet anyone in person. I‚Äôm not as trained as many of you and as I am up north in Washington I wouldn‚Äôt be as available for assistance, but I appreciate being able to stay informed and be able to be more help as things continue. "
2020-09-15 17:09:00,D,"Shelly nailed it.. ""with egos in check"" informed leadership can appropriately direct the proper course of action. They are not ordering you to do what they want.. they will be directing , based on the information coming in, who, what ,when where and why... "
2020-09-15 17:20:00,Bravo91,"In the end, everyone is their own person and can make their own decisions. That's your God given right. It comes down to this (which was the same rules as the portland op on the 22nd): We all are working together, and want to back each other. But if you are going to do your own thing and charge into the fray, and it puts the rest of the Coalition at risk to bail you out, you're one your own. We said it again and again on the 22nd. If we can help in any way we will. I'm not wanting to see people leave, nor will I boot anyone out over this. I want all of us to work together. Defend each other. Once we start bickering and arguing amongst ourselves the battle is lost "
2020-09-15 17:20:00,Bravo91,"I've only met a handful of you in person, and its not my place to tell you what to do. Anything I say/do is out of concern for each and every American out there. I've said my piece. "
2020-09-15 17:20:00,Russ -Redmond,I put this to all the leads. We form separate arms inside the same organization. A Community Service and Community Defense. Any member can take part in either arm. It seems to me that both are going to be needed going forward. Neither are wrong nor are they more important than the other. Each must be in play equally otherwise we those this fight.  A Regional lead to coordinate each Arm in each region. We can show a collected organized well put together team to help in whatever our communities need. Rules of actions can then be put out for each mission. We can be gummby and transfer our numbers to whichever is needed more at any moment. We would be strong and flexible. God bless. And remember the the 26th is looming and they gather their strength and educate while we are fighting and struggling. 
2020-09-15 17:20:00,Flash,"This is Shelb...we were evacuated from our home. We live near Salem. We are also both veterans who served in Iraq, patriotic, and know how to handle weapons. We have been helping out at the fairgrounds as well as taking care of our own animals. At night we would go out to our area, knowing homes were vacated and patrol for looters and anyone who should not appear out in that area. As well as check on anyone else who happened to stay back. We were not being irresponsible or chasing ghosts. We also have no intent of giving the group a bad name, and have actually not mentioned belonging to this group to anyone. So what exactly is a patriot? What does a normal everyday person think when they hear the term patriot? This is what needs to be thought of when out and about. We want people on our side not against us or looking at us as troublemakers. I have often felt we are alone in this area as we don't get much in the way of responses. We want to know others are there if needed. "
2020-09-15 17:20:00,Trent -Medford,Jd Let figure on how to make this work not fight each other we need to move forward and talk about tomorrow and the future and our goal 
2020-09-15 17:20:00,T.Durden,"I agree with Russ. And I believe this group needs to be flexible. We don't know what each day will bring obviously. Who knew they would start burning down the country side¬ø? We need to be constantly ready for whatever explosion of shit happens. And the more numbers we have, the easier that will be. More experience and ideas that can be called upon when it is needed. "
2020-09-15 17:20:00,Chris Tough,"@Flash First thank you for your service. What I we took issue with was people out chasing other patriots thinking they were suspect. Being outside of our own areas of the community we automatically become suspect to those in areas likes yours, you know your neighbors, you know your area. "
2020-09-15 17:20:00,D,Regional organization.. we could have solved this with that type of leadership. It needs to be installed 
2020-09-15 17:20:00,Country Girl,Would it be possible for leaders to have a closed site to where we could give information? We could give info but only the leaders could see it and would respond on either ‚Äúopen site‚Äù if the information was legit and reliable? 
2020-09-15 17:20:00,Bravo91,"@D i agree with you on that. Us that are leads in s oregon have no clue what all goes on in the northern counties and it isn't right for us to be giving out directions for up there. And vice versa. Personally I think we need regional leads, and a separate chat thread for that. That way if there is a need for a call out, it goes to the regional leads and they can discuss what all is needed for that, whether it be a full call out, or just that region. "
2020-09-15 17:20:00,T.Durden,Today I took BCP out to the country side so he could show people what's really going on. Conservatives don't like to be on camera much but hopefully there was enough ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
2020-09-15 17:20:00,Whitebear,Regional leaders was the way it was in the beginning! This has gone so far from the way it began! 
2020-09-15 17:20:00,T.Durden,What are the regions?? Who is the lead for each region?? 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Sam O,Why were you evacuated near salem? 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Todd,"Until recently I was lane county chapter commander of the Combat Veterans Association. I left because most leaders didn‚Äôt have the balls to stand up for what‚Äôs right and very few members actually participated. What I did like about it was the structure of the organization. There were region reps, state reps and chapter commanders. Every chapter had a chapter executive board that heard items brought up by members and everything was voted on. I understand we don‚Äôt have the numbers for a complex structure but a chain of command helps keeps things in order without chaos. "
2020-09-15 17:54:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"I just received this from a number I don‚Äôt know. I can tell all here as a combat veteran that I had no interest in this group until the fires and personally told someone from here to stay the fuck away from Portland and Eugene. Those are not areas I‚Äôm familiar with, and it is stupid to travel to an unknown area with little to no intel. That folks, is how soldiers and warriors get killed. I know from experience.   "
2020-09-15 17:54:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,The people who were out In linn county were working In Their area. Trent and dan have no fucking idea what they are talking about. JD made the suggestion that we use flagging tape to identify patriots vehicles to prevent us from chasing each other which was a very smart idea. But the power hungry brothers can‚Äôt take suggestions because they know it all and they will lead you all in Portland to get run off by Antifa again. Yes I‚Äôm saying it. The last mission to Portland was a FAIL along with many other missions that failed. To Trent and dan. Good luck. I hope you don‚Äôt get people from the coalition killed because of your ignorance and little man syndrome. 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Chris Tough,"@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county Trent nor Dan asked to be leads. We went to Portland to stand for an event, when the event was over it was time to leave so we left. Think what you want but we have no ego in this. There is no room for our egos at the table of patriotism. They did not ask to be leads. "
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Punisher95,I feel like what we've been doing so far is great with the exception of the fires everybody got a little crazyand I understand that however I will follow whatever the lead tell me to do I trust them 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,I didn‚Äôt say that they asked and have no idea how the group leadership was decided. I passed on a text I just received. 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Chris Tough,"@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county Trent and Dan have come here for every fucking thing asked. Every time a call out came out these guys were here. When the fires hit they spent their time helping their community evacuate, get animals to safety. Not once did they ask anyone on here for help or put a call out for shit. You wanna talk trash about two guys that HAVE BEEN HERE for everyone. Take a hike. "
2020-09-15 17:54:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,Lol @Chris Tough 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Punisher95,@Chris Tough agreed 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,Reading and comprehension not a strong suit with some 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Punisher95,Hey now I talk to text Sorry that I love to spell everything out with commas and whenever 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Chris Tough,@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county Do you have anything to contribute to this other then talking shit ? Kahrheart has left the group. 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,I don‚Äôt think I have talked shit. I passed on a text and gave my opinion. Thought this group wanted input and honesty? 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Trent -Medford,JD Yes we do have a fucken idea on how to run things sorry that we are not out to just pick a fight or thing we will have a right to put road blocks up and pull guns on people if you or who ever wants to question my leadership or dans with the comment we put into this group can fuck off an get the fuck out of the group And yes me and dan know what we are doing we do alll of this down where we are at the right way so if you are wanting to bitch and pull this attitude and not work together move on no room for you and your ego 
2020-09-15 17:54:00,Nowhere_M¬≤,Hope all can just wait to hear how this works out....new to y'all but I bet we are all PATRIOTS... 
2020-09-15 18:17:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,Anything I have posted has nothing to do with ego. 
2020-09-15 18:17:00,Sam O,"When quoting a text, using quotation marks helps with confusion The tape was a good idea, but other groups, an unaffiliated people wouldn't have any clue. Running around hell and back chasing every ""tip"" seemed like a bad idea to me. There were many people who were on our side being fingered as antifa pyros. With emotions running high, the likelihood of people taking friendly fire was high. I also don't think Dan was only talking about this group making bad press, but militias in general making us all look like idiots by making ""checkpoints"". "
2020-09-15 18:24:00,Trent -Medford,So JD Are you in? Can you listen to leads in this group and regional leaders or are you out simple yes or no ? 
2020-09-15 18:24:00,Bravo91,@T.Durden leads and regions are something the group will have to come together for a sit down and decide. Im not going to start assigning that. That needs to be a collective decision 
2020-09-15 18:32:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,Loaded question Trent. So my answer is yes and no depending on the situation. 
2020-09-15 18:32:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"@Sam O I did not use tips or information from here while I was out in East Linn-Co. I simply put out where I was on here so that a few, that I personally know from here, in the area, would know MY situation. While out, I was personally Thanked by a OSP possum cop( game warden ü§™) and 2 LCSO. If that was too much for this group then so be it. But I‚Äôm not here to cause trouble nor get anyone hurt. "
2020-09-15 18:32:00,Sam O,"I think being in your own area is whatever. I'd do the same. Maybe I'm mixing groups up, but some people wanted to go into the canyon and hunt pyros/looters "
2020-09-15 18:32:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,I was not one of those. I stay in my AO. 
2020-09-15 18:32:00,Mark Melchi,"I love lamp! Listen guys, I know everything is hot right now, but let's not let this ruin divide another great patriot group which will allow Antifa to win. I believe you guys can work this out 1776 2.0 guys are always here to support you guys and can help plan or develop ideas along with you. I can even invite you guys to one of our training events/range days and can get everyone talking around a fun day of training. I will provide the beers and range. STAY STRONG, relax. Check egos as the door and work together to beat these fucks. "
2020-09-15 18:32:00,Whitebear,"Cool your jets kids. At this point, since there is no leadership, avoid big confrontations, like in Portland! Protect your homefront and be smart. "
2020-09-15 18:32:00,Country Girl,Maybe we need to take a breather 
2020-09-15 18:32:00,Sam O,"Stayton community connections and a couple others was inundated with some of the same pictures and reports as on here, and in their panicked state, were pointing out vehicles that weren't in their immediate knowledge. And people were like ""hey that's me! I'm not antifa!"" "
2020-09-15 18:32:00,David Willis,Negative on a breather ghost rider we need to get our shit together quikly this group made. Difference aug 17 and is needed Sept 26 in PDX 
2020-09-15 18:32:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"Copy that @Sam O but as stated before, I was not in that nor would I be unless personally called for help. "
2020-09-15 18:32:00,T.Durden,"One of the check points in our area was probably one of the more serious ones. The cop thanked everyone for being out and helping and advised them about stopping anyone in the road way and some of the legal issues they could face. He advised them to strategically park several vehicles in such a way that anyone coming thru would have to do so very slowly and be very obvious about taking their pictures of both vehicles and faces. And let them know that barrels down at the low ready position is not ""brandishing a weapon"" "
2020-09-15 18:32:00,David Willis,Time to put the fire shit behind us and prepare to defend against antifain pdx. Antifa is going to bring there A team the 26th we need to be ready 
2020-09-15 18:32:00,Country Girl,We NEED EVERYONE! I just don‚Äôt want this group to dissolve. 
2020-09-15 18:32:00,T.Durden,"Their A team may be short a few hands. The ""whitehouse siege"" is supposed to be in full effect. "
2020-09-15 18:32:00,David Willis,Trust me they are bringing in all of there shitheads from all over the country 
2020-09-15 18:32:00,Dee,If I'm not mistaken..@JD passed on a text from someone and it wasn't him shit talking. If I read that message right 
2020-09-15 18:32:00,Sam O,@jd we all get bunched in with others sometimes. They didn't want people getting hurt by chasing unverified tips. @Dee you are correct. I don't think people actually caught that 
2020-09-15 18:44:00,Chris Tough,I did not catch that. 
2020-09-15 18:44:00,Chris Tough,Obviously. 
2020-09-15 18:44:00,Sam O,"My biggest fear about guys diving around patrolling is patriots pulling guns on patriots, and having a shootout because they don't know who they're up against. "
2020-09-15 18:44:00,Country Girl,I guess I am out of the loop of what is going down on the 26th. Let me know how so can help 
2020-09-15 18:44:00,Iron Wolf 9,"Currently on the road , but it appears to me that the issue surrounding recent events is more the execution and less the intent.  Therefore I propose leadership get together and codify a code of conduct/ rules of engagement that must be adhered to when acting under the auspices or in representation of the Coalition .  That being said , we are all free Americans and free to act as we believe fit, but it must and should be understood that to act outside of the parameters of conduct is to relinquish access to Coalition resources during said action / event unless expressly cleared by respective leadership.  We must maintain continuity and expectation of action in the field .  "
2020-09-15 18:44:00,Dub,ÔøºI agree on the regions and the need for regional leaders. It‚Äôs not always possible for Trent and Dan to get to Eugene or Salem fast enough to help if something goes bad. As far as I know we have a lot of trained combat veterans in the group that would make great regional leaders. We need to split up duties for different zones. Each leader would have a group of guys and gals under them in that zone. If we need help in that area we call the the closest leader and his/her people and in the next zone. 
2020-09-15 18:44:00,Jeffro,Meeting with proud boys to take Portland back 
2020-09-15 18:44:00,Sam O,"I guarantee I don't know everyone on my mountain, or who's supposed to here or not. Too many cooks in the kitchen. But I think we should get beyond this. The fires are dying down, soon it's going to be flooding. "
2020-09-15 18:44:00,Country Girl,"If I can‚Äôt make it up to PdX, how else can I help? "
2020-09-15 19:09:00,Iron Wolf 9,"The great differentiator between us and the opponents of our liberty are our ideals, and these ideals must be realised through equally lofty actions and behaviours worthy of our beliefs and cause.  In a world where the media is openly hostile and everything is a capture device the way we hold and conduct ourselves will be imperative moving forward.  And our conduct and execution must be so that our fellow Americans whom we offer our time and hold out our hand in service to are not only grateful and welcoming to it, but are moved to offer themselves and do it too. Debbie has left the group. "
2020-09-15 19:09:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"For those who missed it, the event is the Proud boys have put put out a video and flyer for an event to ""take back"" Portland on May 26th. "

2020-09-15 19:33:00,D,"Going through the comments...i suggest we change the title from ""leaders"" to ""representatives "" just in case there is a problem with the word "
2020-09-15 19:33:00,Shelb,"@Sam O If someone is going to be carrying a weapon then they need to be level headed, and use wisdom when confronted with a situation. If they are one to panic, and immediately start shooting,, at their own ""perceived"" idea of a threat, they shouldn't be carrying. No one should be doing any shooting unless their life is in danger or someone elses. Patrolling ones own area, along with other known patriots, using some form of challenge/pw or glo sticks etc...is a good idea to keep folks aware and know who all is in the area helping. Having some form of radio communication would be nice. Also, at the last event we attended in Portland. 3 of us were left behind. We watched as Antifa passed on by us, except for some that stayed behind to heckle us. This required keeping a cool head so we could safely get back to our vehicle. We walked on by other Antifa. So to keep everyone safe, there needs to be better commo, teamwork /support, accountability, equipment for all, and training. We were evacuated because the fire was within 6-10 miles "
2020-09-15 19:45:00,Country Girl,"Shelb, where do you live?Ôøº "
2020-09-15 19:45:00,Sawyer,"Our thought down here was, if this IS a nation wide event, out of towners won't be able to carry... And the Ants have escalated once already... Maybe the local folks SHOULD carry incase of escalation. "

2020-09-15 20:07:00,Bravo91,@Whitebear agreed. And we will. 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Whitebear,Thank god!!! 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Dee,On a serious note..I think people were thrown off by the change in leadership and not knowing why. 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Bravo91,"Also, im glad to see everyone is safe! Now let's see how long until Kommander Kate talks about the sudden ""spike in covid cases"" that's bound to happen with everything going on. "
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Dee,Too much stress and tension over the last week and people came out sideways ..would be my guess. 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Whitebear,I have watched the group since the beginning...I know why.... 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Bravo91,"@Dee i agree, which is why I brought it up. "
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Sam O,"So, I learned a lesson today "
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Bravo91,Whats that? 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Sam O,Don't send the lady to get the dog washed at the same place they sell chicks... 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Bravo91,....how many came home? 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Sam O,"Broody hen ""wanted babies"". Now she has 6 "

2020-09-15 20:15:00,D,Quick question. On the 26th.. are the proud boys calling the shots? Is there a time line? I 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Sam O,The dog is no longer toasted marshmallow color though. 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Bravo91,"We don't know, they're not telling us anything at this moment. We're going to reach out and tell them to give us some kind of details or else we're out. We aren't going into a war zone blind. "
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Dee,Daniel is really receptive and easy to reach 
2020-09-15 20:15:00,Bravo91,I think there's a phone call going out to them tomorrow. We'll know more soon. 
2020-09-15 20:26:00,D,A phone call? One of our guys to one of their guys? 
2020-09-15 20:26:00,Bravo91,Yes. A lead to a lead. I dont know all the details yet. 
2020-09-15 20:26:00,D,No need for the details.. just as long as there are plans in place. 
2020-09-15 20:26:00,Bravo91,"We'll make sure there are. If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, is Joe Biden still a creep? "

2020-09-15 21:58:00,Robert Carroll,Are you all familiar with the Clackamas County Deputys that were let go because of the statements made on a video? 
2020-09-15 21:58:00,Dub,@Robert Carroll Yes sir 
2020-09-16 07:58:00,Robert Carroll,"Has the video of the meeting of county commissioners and CCSO been posted here? Clearly shows then saying exactly what the deputies said that were fired. Only difference, it‚Äôs from days before the deputies said it. Security Check Required facebook.com "

2020-09-16 08:36:00,Bravo91,You'd have to go into settings and change info there 
2020-09-16 08:36:00,Dragonfly,Is there an app I need to download for that? 
2020-09-16 08:36:00,Boarhead M¬≤,Where it says daily chatter far right 3 dots

2020-09-16 08:52:00,T.Durden,"Dragonfly you need to download the ""groupme"" app "
2020-09-16 08:59:00,Dragonfly,My handle should now be changed. 
2020-09-16 09:14:00,Todd,@Bravo91 I sent you a PM Robert Carroll changed name to Fishguy71 Dragonfly changed name to Roger Charlie Bravo 
2020-09-16 09:14:00,T.Durden,I just got access to the crowd dispersal spray that the feds use. It's 40 bucks a can. Usual 65 bucks. Anybody want any?? 
2020-09-16 09:14:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,They caught an arsonist in Kelso Wa. His bond is only $120 to get out (10% of 1200). His name is Adnick Andreas  Grrrr. 
2020-09-16 09:14:00,Alena,A bunch of folks are planning on flooding the prosecutor‚Äôs office with emails today regarding the Kelso arrest. 
2020-09-16 09:14:00,Sawyer,Is there a break for pallets of it? Lol. SPICY! 
2020-09-16 09:17:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,What‚Äôs the email? 
2020-09-16 09:17:00,T.Durden,"Is there an email address for those of us who would like to join the effort. Sawyer, I'm sure there is a price break point, but I don't know what it is. I'm getting it thru a security contractor. "
2020-09-16 09:17:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,I was asking about the email for the prosecutor in kelso. 
2020-09-16 09:17:00,Alena,I‚Äôll get it. One moment. 
2020-09-16 09:17:00,Sawyer,@T.Durden copy 
2020-09-16 09:30:00,Avatar,Trent -Medford Sorry guys didn‚Äôt get done till midnight  Leads are still the same let‚Äôs keep moving forward  There will be some changes as we go I‚Äôm going to assign regional leaders soon I will work on that  Need intel vetting team who wants to volunteer for that ?  I will work on a better vetting process For new patriots  So give me a couple of days to figure it out thanks everyone  
2020-09-16 09:30:00,Sunshine,"üíôüíôüíôüíô is it possible to have an in person gathering before the 26th so we can get aligned. I really really want to be a part of this. Im a pissed off American who loves our country deeply. Some of us have zero training but huge hearts! There are many positions to hold and grow with in our group. We have an amazing grit to get er done, i just feel the need for a connect to smooth our edges. Our opponents have had years to form their alignment and that gives them an advantage (per say). Our hearts and determination is what puts us in front lets keep it that way. Some of us have spent lots of $$ to prepare for the next event and we still need help from leadership to ensure we are properly protected, armed and placed. I know we have the whole fire thing going on but...Is it possible for someone between VC and Medford to host? We would but our house is a bit small. I'll bring food! "
2020-09-16 09:30:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,My current location is SW WA. You needs done here? 
2020-09-16 09:30:00,Trent -Medford,Yes is also what I‚Äôm trying to set up What is a middle ground to meet up for everyone half way point 
2020-09-16 09:30:00,Alena,@Sunshine I‚Äôm with ya! 
2020-09-16 09:30:00,Sawyer,Eugene I would imagine... Stumptown could come down and Medford could come up. Coasies can come over... Coasties 
2020-09-16 09:42:00,Trent -Medford,That‚Äôs what I was thinking 
2020-09-16 09:42:00,Raider12,We would need a location that is convenient from the freeway but not visible to ants. 
2020-09-16 09:52:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,Salem would be a good point for us in WA 
2020-09-16 09:52:00,Ewok,"I'm in Eugene Give me a date, time and how many and I could probably find a place. "
2020-09-16 09:52:00,Sunshine,"We may need to be at a house or secluded park depending on how many can attend. Looks like we are still 25 for a gathering. Anybody own a farm? We could do an outdoor gathering, bring some pop up awnings for cover if needed? "
2020-09-16 09:52:00,Todd,City park in Brownsville has a huge covered area with plenty of tables. Well at least it was there before fires not so sure now . 
2020-09-16 09:58:00,Ewok,I might be able to get the ok at New Hope college and would be indoors. 
2020-09-16 09:58:00,Chris Tough,I could possibly have something for us. 
2020-09-16 10:10:00,Ewok,"I also have a connection at Camp Tadmor, east of Sweethome. "
2020-09-16 10:10:00,Chris Tough,I‚Äôve got someone with a farm in creswell willing to let us all meet there. We can use the barn to meet in. I can go take a look at it today to make sure it‚Äôs accommodating 
2020-09-16 10:10:00,Sunshine,"Ok, lets send potential places to Trent so he can figure out the best location for all of our needs. I dont care what day we schedule this for. I know alot of us work and have our personal lives to deal with. Im thinking Sunday is our best option. Most would normally be available. That leaves us just 6 days before we head into town again. Not alot of time to gather up extra supplies. Lets make this happen, more than anything, right now we need unity! @Chris Tough. Liking that idea "
2020-09-16 10:10:00,Alena,"Idk for sure if we can make it down and as we have been working on our shop roof into between everything else this week, but look forward to hopefully getting down there. I‚Äôm about 3 hours from the border of Oregon so makes it a little tough. :/ "
2020-09-16 10:10:00,Sunshine,üíôüíô is there a way of video chatting for some who are arent close? 
2020-09-16 10:10:00,Erik,Count me in on the training. 
2020-09-16 11:09:00,Alena,Ditto^^ 
2020-09-16 11:09:00,Ewok,"I know we got a lot on our plates, but I just saw this post. Oops, should have sent to our intel, sorry slap me later. "
2020-09-16 12:11:00,Sawyer,Whack! 
2020-09-16 12:11:00,Bravo91,https://eugeneantifa.noblogs.org/post/2020/09/15/richard-bowman/ Eugene antifa has a new blog in with some doxxing. Names they have in there Richard Bowman Emma Mitchum Michelle Yates Rob Cattrall Cole Scott Travis Taylor Logan Lingren Rob Ellis Matt Horton Sean Tahtinen Brian Cornelius Chris and Alena Mack  
2020-09-16 12:11:00,Sawyer,Get OUT OF MY HEAD! I was just reading that! 
2020-09-16 12:11:00,Bravo91,Just a heads up to anyone who is here or knows these people 
2020-09-16 12:18:00,Sawyer,I was on the Rose City Antifa twitter tho. 
2020-09-16 12:18:00,T.Durden,I need input on sizes for plates. What is the most common and useful size. So far it looks like 10X12 but 1 person has asked me for an 11X12 The coating adds to dinesion. So a 10 wide actually comes out to about 10 1/4 inches I have to do all the coatings at once for money reasons. These plates should effectively be a level 4 but Trent will be testing them when they are finish so that is YTBD. 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Dub,@Iron Wolf 9 Damn dude they made you famous. Fuc- em I‚Äôll go to war with you anytime brother 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Sawyer,Rma1155 plates are the best deal I could find. Lead time is the killer. Getting anything before the 26th may be tough... 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,T.Durden,I'm making plates 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Jay Thomas,I got some on order from ar500 and they said 8-10 weeksüò¢ 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,T.Durden,I need a lead to call me asap. I just got Intel from a back end source. Orders that were just given out. Fed orders 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Chris Tough,Pm sent 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Sam O,"Hey, for those ordering anything offline, DO NOT USE FEDEX. if you have to, buy the FedEx express shipping, it's a different company. I had 2 separate orders that possibly got sent on the same truck and both are ""pending"". FedEx said I may have to file a lost package form. Ar500 guy told me if it comes to that, file a police report, because there's no way they both ""got lost"" They lost some 500 orders for 1 gun store, and couldn't ""find"" them until they threatened to sic the ATF after them "
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Chris Tough,@T.Durden I sent you a pm 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Jay Thomas,@Sam O You‚Äôre making me nervous man lol 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Alena,Just got my ammo order for my 9 and our 12 gauge today from Outdoor limited through UPS. This was a huge concern for me so now I know not order from them ever. Also Outdoor Limited had the best ammo prices I could find as almost all of our local stores are out. 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Sam O,I don't know if my last message posted. I'm kind of worried there's people at the hubs stalling orders to screw with people. One of our guys said that he saw a video of people at a hub going through ammo Bravo91 added Steve Burnette to the group. 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Dee,"@Sunshine I totally agree! I had a hard time at an event trying to pass info to our team when people weren't getting the message to retreat. It is cliche, but at the events all the Patriots look alike..lol "
2020-09-16 12:19:00,David,I ordered ammo for my 45 from Outdoor Limited IT HAS NOT ARRIVED! The website says don't email or call them. I won' t be using them again! 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Dub,I always buy ammo on gun broker it‚Äôs expensive but always available and you can get it shipped within a week usually. All popular calibers are available 
2020-09-16 12:19:00,1911,"I've bought ammo through ""Cheaper than dirt"" and they've always been reliable for me "
2020-09-16 12:19:00,Jay Thomas,Cheaper than dirt has been great the times I have used them 
2020-09-16 13:02:00,Raider12,Look for ammo on Northwest Firearms classifieds. 
2020-09-16 13:02:00,Sam O,"Ammo is one thing, losing 2 orders worth $600 is another. "
2020-09-16 13:02:00,Dub,@Sam O Yes that sucks I hope they find it 
2020-09-16 13:02:00,Sam O,They said they'll ship out another order if they have to. So their customer service is definitely 10/10 
2020-09-16 13:02:00,Kendall,Thank God for reloading otherwise I'd have very little ammo lol 
2020-09-16 13:24:00,Todd,Extremely hard to get primers too. I‚Äôve only got 700 left 
2020-09-16 14:32:00,Erik,@Todd I just used the last of my small pistol primers last week. I cant find any anywhere. 
2020-09-16 14:32:00,Mark Melchi,If anyone needs plates or Carriers I can I can usually get them in 3-5 days And Ammo 
2020-09-16 14:32:00,Bravo91,Can you get me a M1 abrams? 
2020-09-16 14:32:00,Mark Melchi,Done 
2020-09-16 14:32:00,Avatar,"Erik @Mark Melchi what type just steel plates, ceramic coated? "
2020-09-16 14:32:00,Mark Melchi,"I cam get steel, ceramic, Hybrid, ultra light, pretty much whatever. From level 3A up. Have two arms dealers in my group. "
2020-09-16 15:13:00,Sawyer,Oh... Yeah... The M1 then... We'll do a GoFundMe for it! 
2020-09-16 15:13:00,Bravo91,"Ok gang, I know we talking about our hardware, but we need to cool it on that chatter. Prying eyes are everywhere. Opsec is a high priority "
2020-09-16 15:13:00,Mark Melchi,@Bravo91 so you don't want the M1 is that what you're saying? lol 
2020-09-16 15:13:00,Bravo91,I didn't say that! 
2020-09-16 15:27:00,11/b. J,My sons training in the new Abrams as we speak so I could ask for tips bro .

2020-09-16 15:29:00,Trent -Medford,Fine Can I write it off as a company vehicle 
2020-09-16 16:18:00,Bravo91,"""Whats the tank for?"" ""Fixing signs"" "
2020-09-16 16:18:00,Sam O,"You're going to want to use a spear for that, swords aren't well equipped for poking distant targets "
2020-09-16 16:28:00,Hockie,Yeah but then you can't be as epic as this Commissar 
2020-09-16 17:08:00,Sam O,Haha

2020-09-16 18:13:00,Todd,Tannerite store off I-5 near Harley has plates also. Good veterans discount too. 
2020-09-16 18:13:00,Sawyer,And the adult shop is next door... Win win! 
2020-09-16 18:13:00,Sam O,Maybe that's what they meant to do? 
2020-09-16 18:13:00,Mark Melchi,Hi guys contact our guy for Ammo and plates. Usually insock. And I have another contact for cheaper plates 
2020-09-16 18:13:00,GSipe,Down range industry has plates also. Two day shipping. Can find them on Facebook and eBay 129$ shipped 
2020-09-16 18:13:00,Dee,Saw this today in Troutdale. It made my heart happy. Safe to say they aren't a Biden supporter. 
2020-09-16 18:13:00,Whitebear,"So, what happened to the website!? "
2020-09-16 18:13:00,Bravo91,I'm not sure what happened Serious question though.... 
2020-09-16 18:13:00,Whitebear,"It says, from what I understand, that it was an Admin block... "
2020-09-16 18:13:00,Mark Melchi,Sometimes if the person who created it leaves it will automatically archive it. 
2020-09-16 18:29:00,Whitebear,Thanks Mark... 
2020-09-16 18:29:00,David Willis,So i ordered off of Botachs. Website and got two sets of soft plates rated 3a and two vism carriers for $100 a set. Please take not it took 11 days for them to ship but i did get the items quickly once they did ship. Probly too late for the event on the 26th but for the future or if someone is looming for a cheap keep in ur car or close in the house set this is for u 
2020-09-16 18:29:00,GSipe,If you order from down range industry you will have the. By the 26th 
2020-09-16 19:22:00,David Willis,So it was 220 with shipping for 2 sets. If you read botachs reviews prepare to be mortified. I can say i was not happy with waiting 11 days for the item to ship. And these are not hard plates they are soft and only pistol rated and stab proof. The carrier is cheep but the entire set is super lite and covers the important parts. Could easely be worn under a jacket and no one would know 
2020-09-16 20:04:00,D,"Once again, I do have a brand new shellback PC olive drab with pouches.. no need to wait on shipping "
2020-09-16 20:04:00,Dub,@D Is it just the carrier ? 
2020-09-16 20:04:00,D,Yeah... im going to keep my plates 
2020-09-16 20:04:00,Dub,Ok 
2020-09-16 20:14:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"I have a question for management. You plan on going to Portland. Knowing the situation is bad for our side. What is your plan to ID those from here and what is the comms plan?  Trent was fired up, and asked me directly if I was in.....or out.  I‚Äôm asking management, if you want backing to go into a hot zone, what is your intel and plan for going hot? ID of those following you? Plan for evac? "
2020-09-16 20:14:00,Chris Tough,"We are talking about this right now. Apologies, I know everyone is wondering and waiting. We are working hard to make sure we are taking the proper steps. Bare with us. "
2020-09-16 20:14:00,Trent -Medford,JD Enough doing this on the chatter if you want to talk you can call me I‚Äôm not going to do this again tonight !!!! 
2020-09-16 20:14:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"Why not Trent? You can call me but you are asking non trained, to go into a hot zone. They deserve to know the plan And I‚Äôm very willing to give you my number. "
2020-09-16 20:14:00,Bravo91,"We're working and discussing a plan. Simple as that. Once we have it figured out, we'll share it. And get thoughts and input "
2020-09-16 20:14:00,Chris Tough,"I have met a lot of you. You know me as himwho. We all want what‚Äôs best. @JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county We are not asking anyone to go into a hot zone without being given information and direction We are working on it. A lot has come to our attention that we as leads have to process and vet to make sure we act on correct information @JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county I understand your concerns. Bare with us. We want what‚Äôs best for this group and everyone in it. We all love our country, we all love our community‚Äôs. We as a group have to move as one, together, this only works if we work together. We understand this and want everyone to play their part, we also want you to have the proper information to make your own decisions. Again we have to make sure the information we get is viable and true. We will get with you. Please bare with us and have a little more patience. "
2020-09-16 20:46:00,Trent -Medford,Jd Just pm u 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Chris Tough,@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county Are you wanting to go to Portland? 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"@Chris Tough Absolutely not under your leadership. I‚Äôm not saying I won‚Äôt be there, but if I am, it will be under a Teamleader and we have comms set "
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Chris Tough,Fair enough. I won‚Äôt waste anymore time trying to speak to you then. Maybe you should be the lead of this group since your all knowing and have all the experience. Seems like that‚Äôs what you want. If the leads in this group are not up to snuff in your opinion you don‚Äôt have to be in this group. 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county what is your malfunction? When they're telling you they're working hard on intel and will have info to you asap, that should be sufficient. I see a self control risk. üö© "
2020-09-16 20:54:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"Maybe I should then. I‚Äôd have proven leadership with plans in place.  And to make it clear, I have only asked questions that any trained soldiers would ask. I have not asked, even with past leadership to have any chips in this game except for me voluntarily giving my time.  "
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Chris Tough,@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county Seems like the only reason you are still here is to tell the leads in this group how much you diss like our leadership. 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Tony,ü§® 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Whitebear,Implosion.... 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Chris Tough,"We have all stood shoulder to shoulder, I don‚Äôt recall ever seeing you on the front line with us.? Have you been? "
2020-09-16 20:54:00,JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county,"@Chris Tough Maybe instead of trying to be a boss, be a leader. "
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Chris Tough,@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county Why don‚Äôt you go start your own group and show us all how it‚Äôs done then. 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Trent -Medford,@JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county I‚Äôm trying to work with u but u don‚Äôt to listen that we are going threw changes an we are working on a plan But you want to fight us the whole So saying we don‚Äôt need this your removed from the group 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Sawyer,"Look, I know we're new here... But this isn't painting a very good picture. Morale is already down, and any good leader would realize that morale is A Lot. We were looking for a solid Coilition to go to battle with, and now we're left scratching our heads. Trent -Medford removed JD Lake/Deschutes/Linn county from the group.  "
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Dee,Girls..girls..you're both prettyüòç Sorry..just trying to lighten the mood. Probably doesn't help..but this is ridiculous. 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"Woah... enough already! They're working on it. A lot of intel coming in even just today. Changes in plans of PB. We have time. Relax please. These guys really care. A lot is on the line for all of us. Show some respect and be patient. If you don't have self control here, what will you be like out there? "
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Dee,Haha..I posted before seeing the removal 
2020-09-16 20:54:00,Sawyer,I trust that everyone is trying their hardest and that it's tense right now. We wish the best and loo forward to good things Look....urgh.... 
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Shelley - Vancouver,That's a relief! Sorry but we have to have some patience and respect. The leads are slammed and they just need us to hold tight a little longer. We are all here for a great cause. Let's have their backs! 
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Chris Tough,"@Sawyer we are scratching our heads as well. The intel we are getting makes it hard to make a solid plan. Not only that, but we can‚Äôt share everything with everyone in here that is not or does not want to go to Portland if we go. "
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Sam O,"Our group had a similar guy. He wanted us to go to the last Portland event, but we weren't ready. He just bitched up a storm, ridiculed us, then went with other guys. He promised something big, but I never saw him accomplish anything. "
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"Now, back to the drunk memes, please?! Lol gotta admit those were great. Idc who you are! "
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Sawyer,@Chris Tough I get it. I have a group of 12 and it's tough... Keep moving forward and we'll get this. 
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Punisher95,That guy was fuck nuts 
2020-09-16 21:08:00,11/b. J,"Haters gonna hate , we all still here . No worries and let's go . "
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Dee,"I am so glad that is over. He seemed like he had good motivation, but hot headed. It's one thing to question in private but blasting disrespectful and snarky remarks is not a good team building exercise. Thanks @Trent -Medford "
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Sam O,Our guy was just looking for a fight. 
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Bravo91,Jesus tits...I get up to let my dogs out and see i missed a shitstorm. 
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Ewok,"How about we give all chatter a break, let our current leadership get to work and wait patiently for direction. God bless this group and God Bless America "
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Shelley - Vancouver,Lmao Jesus tits... thanks for that visual. Lmao 
2020-09-16 21:08:00,Bravo91,@Shelley - Vancouver you're welcome

2020-09-16 21:13:00,Bravo91,No one is worse than me 
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Todd,I agree with Trent‚Äôs decision to remove that guy. He wasn‚Äôt listening and seemed like a drama queen. 
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Sam O,Homebrew baby! 
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Shelley - Vancouver,Cheers! 
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Country Girl,Shot of whiskey! 
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Punisher95,He was the only one that was making a problem out of it 
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Shelley - Vancouver,I don't even drink but I'm hitting the bottle! Lol 
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Dub,@Sam O you tease üçªüçª 
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Bravo91,@Sawyer go ahead and mute the group for a spell. Ill let ya know if something pertinent pops up 
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Sam O,"If we have a get together I'll bring a keg. I screwed up the sparge while trying a new technique, and it's a whopping 4.5%, but tastes great! "
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Bravo91,"And I'm going to crash out, but not before I leave y'all this "
2020-09-16 21:13:00,Shelley - Vancouver,You guys and ladies rock! :) everything is gonna be just fine! :) proud to be a part of this group! We will do great things! God bless you all! Trent -Medford removed Red from the group.

2020-09-16 22:52:00,Chris Tough,Appreciate everyone‚Äôs patience. 
2020-09-16 23:16:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,Someone pushing for information on ‚Äúplans‚Äù is always suspect in my mind. 
2020-09-16 23:16:00,Avatar,Trent -Medford So I‚Äôm stepping down immediately Have to do it It‚Äôs bin a big stress on my family and I have to put them first and do what is right for my family It‚Äôs bin a pleasure working with you all it was a honor So again I‚Äôm sorry for this .

2020-09-17 00:00:00,Avatar,Trent -Medford No it‚Äôs not over that issue Just not working out Sorry again 
2020-09-17 00:00:00,Woodsman,Who‚Äôs stepping up? 
2020-09-17 00:00:00,11/b. J,"Trent you and the others took to much on and still did it . Right or wrong brother stepping down isnt gonna help. Please sleep on it ,I understand the toll on your family . At the least take this from me as a grunt. We swore a oath and at the least please stay in the group even if you step down. ROBIN I need you to be a voice of reason . I'll listen to anything but these people dont need chased off watching the wheels fall of.

I'm going and tearing shit up alone if i have to . "
2020-09-17 00:00:00,David Willis,Well said we need to be getting ready for battle 9 days from now 
2020-09-17 00:00:00,11/b. J,God dam right brother. 
2020-09-17 00:00:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,"This is a momentous time in our history and it will shape the course of our children‚Äôs futures. Our duty to our children, family, friends and nation is upon us all. "
2020-09-17 00:00:00,11/b. J,"Besides I'm gonna need some help, I cant listen to the trolls bullshit by myself "
2020-09-17 05:01:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,"What we are doing is not random. Patriots around the country are currently organizing and preparing.  We know D day is coming after November. We know that what we are seeing now is a betrayal of trust of the people by our government. We know that this war has a long time to go. We are not alone. There are people all around us supporting us. There are people all around that would stand side by side with us.  Though times are stressful, we have to dig deep and keep pushing forward. "
2020-09-17 06:26:00,Hockie,Interesting ü§î 
2020-09-17 07:05:00,Dee,"This is not the time for division! We are playing right into the hands of our enemy. While Patriots fight amongst each other, Antifa gathers numbers. Tensions are high and we need to remember that this isn't about a couple people. We are fighting for our country. We should be looking beyond petty disagreements and remember our goal. We need to stand together. "
2020-09-17 07:10:00,Rooster,I say that every time in the last 4 months I've seen a division in groups 
2020-09-17 07:10:00,T.Durden,"Wow, did Antifa just won the war¬ø? Are we about to become socialists?? Is that what happens when the 3% that is willing to fight for what's right is no longer willing?? "
2020-09-17 07:13:00,Ale F,Who said no one is willing Cuz I sure as hell am 
2020-09-17 07:13:00,T.Durden,Leadership all just ducked out. And people have left the group already. And that just started. Is it over?? Or are more leaving¬ø? 
2020-09-17 07:20:00,Rooster,Stand strong 
2020-09-17 07:20:00,Todd,It‚Äôs not over. Regroup and keep moving forward. Is there anyone left from leadership team ? 
2020-09-17 07:20:00,Dee,The 26th is right around the corner and we need to be united. The election is right around the corner. The üêúüêú are going to push forward because hate unites them. We need to remember what we are fighting for and who we are fighting against. People are coming from all over to stand up against the chaos. I will be standing with them regardless of petty differences. 
2020-09-17 07:40:00,Sam O,Dan is still here 
2020-09-17 07:40:00,T.Durden,"Anyone who wants to leave please speak up NOW and get the fukk out! If your unsure or iffy or anything like that, just stay home and wait for the Brown shirts! Everyone else, we need leadership. I know there are a few among us. Chia Tough is still here. Who else is still here that was a member of leadership?? "
2020-09-17 07:40:00,Bravo91,"I'm still here. At work, can't really talk atm. "
2020-09-17 07:40:00,Dee,I've seen the strength and dedication of this group and know this is just a bump in the road. 
2020-09-17 07:40:00,Ale F,Overcome move forward coalition has grown big and strong compared to other groups don't allow this to be an opm 
2020-09-17 07:40:00,Todd,Everyone please keep in mind that this will take a few days to pan out. People still have lives to attend to and may not be able to respond for hours. Let‚Äôs all be patient and NO fighting with ourselves. If someone has an issue with another member please try to talk it out on the phone or in person. Texting not always the best way to communicate. Let‚Äôs work together and come back stronger. 
2020-09-17 07:40:00,Shelley - Vancouver,I'll talk to Trent. He has a lot going on and family comes first. There are other leads still here. Everyone relax. Let's work on a location for a meet up this weekend. We need a face to face. An indoor or rural area near Salem or a little south of there. Just found a supply person yesterday that had a LEO supply shop that closed. He has everything for about 40 people. We'll get through this. Vetting a bunch of intel that came in last 2 days. We're not finished yet 
2020-09-17 08:02:00,Whitebear,So...who and how do we pass intel to at this point? 
2020-09-17 08:02:00,T.Durden,I nominate @Shelley - Vancouver for receiving Intel. She is smart and level headed. And she is involved enough to know who the stuff needs to be handled by in the end. 
2020-09-17 08:02:00,Shelley - Vancouver,I can vet most intel in interim. 
2020-09-17 08:02:00,T.Durden,See¬ø? @Shelley - Vancouver Please don't read my mind anymore ü§™ 
2020-09-17 08:02:00,Shelley - Vancouver,I have been getting and vetting intel and I have been connected to most leaders of other groups. @T.Durden I was writing at same time. Lol 
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Country Girl,"If someone tells me what needs to be done, I can help with intel. "
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"Pm for my number and call me if you have intel. Don't put it on here. If you have a meeting place that's out of sight let me know, I'll check it out. "
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Sam O,"@Shelley - Vancouver I need some more molle crap for my vest, which should ü§û be showing up today.. Finally... "
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Bravo91,"Agreed. Shelley handles intel for the time being. Chris might have us a spot for a meet-up, he was checking a site out last night. He'll get back to us today. "
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"What does everyone want for issue gear? Bump helmets, aluminum shields, vests, gas masks, goggles. Looking to buy out the whole shop. "
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Sam O,"Also, we gotta remember, this is a group of citizens, we do need points of contact, but a definitive leader? Not so sure. Ale F and I are part of a small group that decides things together. The biggest thing is getting with people who are close to your area, coordinating with them, training with them, and getting an emergency plan in place for if anything extreme happens, then just take things as they come with the coalition. Gas mask! "
2020-09-17 08:04:00,T.Durden,I'm lacking a bump helmet. I have everything else 
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Sam O,I have a ACH helmet and have a FAST helmet coming in. 
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Dee,Me and my old man need helmets 
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,@Shelley - Vancouver I am also in SW Washington and am in contact with several patriots in the region. If you need assistance let me know. 
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"@Roger Charlie Bravo pm me Probably easier, if you need gear please pm me. Then I can keep track. "
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Sam O,How do we pm? 
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"Back out of this chat, one click back and start a new one, just start typing name. "
2020-09-17 08:04:00,Roger Charlie Bravo,Or click on the icon for the person in this chat and it will open a chat to that person. 
2020-09-17 08:04:00,T.Durden,Back out of this one click and select the menu in top left corner (3 dash lines) then click contacts. Scroll to the name you want and click it. Option pops up for direct message. Click and start typing. 
2020-09-17 08:46:00,Shelley - Vancouver,Yeah... what he said. Lol 
2020-09-17 08:48:00,Chris Tough,"Good morning everyone. We are not disbanding. We are goin through growing pains. This is not the first or last time we will go through this. This is only going to make us stronger and help us to learn what not to do and what we should do. I‚Äôve got a meeting place in creswell, it s on a farm in a field away from prying ears and eyes. We would need chairs and pop up canopy‚Äôs. If everyone is interested I‚Äôd like to do a pot luck. We all need to come together and figure some things out. There is info you guys need and answers to questions you guys need. Chris Tough added Patriot Coalition Of Oregon to the group. "

2020-09-17 09:33:00,Avatar,"T.Durden @Shelley - Vancouver Can cast my vote for day and time. Broadcasting this in zoom or face time seems like a bad idea. Hell, I'd rather everyone left their phones in vehicles ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "
2020-09-17 09:33:00,Whitebear,Anytime Sunday works for me.

2020-09-17 11:26:00,Sawyer,It'll be frogs... I'm sure of it... 
2020-09-17 11:26:00,Ale F,Local counties are better the know what's best in there own counties and then county leads come together to make decisions how our group does things China got locust already I have yellow Stone going off 
2020-09-17 11:26:00,Sam O,I have a coronal mass ejection 
2020-09-17 11:26:00,Ale F,Going all science huh Sam lol 
2020-09-17 11:26:00,Sam O,"Regions, or counties are good for knowing your closest members, and getting to know them individually on a more frequent basis than the entire group. But as far as only having them? OPM wouldn't let individual counties even talk amongst themselves, much less meet with each other. Nobody communicated with anyone, nobody knew what was happening. It made for an extremely weak group. "
2020-09-17 11:26:00,Raider12,"@Sam O , I think it to smart for this group... "
2020-09-17 11:26:00,Sam O,"And yes, that shit would take us back to the stone age. Possibly the industrial revolution. "
2020-09-17 11:26:00,Patriot Coalition,We had that prior - it didn‚Äôt work at all... it was just a couple months ago that we stopped doing that 
2020-09-17 11:26:00,Sam O,Science science science! Blah blah blah! E=mc2 
2020-09-17 11:26:00,Ale F,You guys ran county by county? 
2020-09-17 11:46:00,Patriot Coalition,"So we have leads who are from southern Oregon, Central/Eastern, Northern and Mid "
2020-09-17 11:47:00,Sam O,"We're trying to have small teams that work together more often. Not really separated, but just so you know your guys and can do drills together. I bought a paintball gun, and am hoping to find another cheap one, so we can run live fire drills on the cheap, and safely. "
2020-09-17 11:47:00,Sam O,"I have 3 acres, 2 of which are wooded. There's too many houses to shoot bullets, but paintball is fine. "
2020-09-17 11:47:00,Ale F,I'ma get one next check to so we can get this going 
2020-09-17 11:47:00,Dee,Have paintball gun...will travel..lol

2020-09-17 11:47:00,Sam O,@Dee you mean with shotgun shell Swenson? ü§£ 
2020-09-17 11:47:00,T.Durden,I can get any Patriot a paintball gun at cost. I also have a Co2 refill station so Co2 is free. And I can get paint by the case at cost 
2020-09-17 11:47:00,Dub,Ok did we decide on a time and date fir a meeting? I‚Äôm so confused I don‚Äôt know whether to bring Pendleton crown royal or Jack Daniels üòÇÔøºÔøº

2020-09-17 11:47:00,Ewok,I got JD covered ü§™ 
2020-09-17 11:47:00,Dee,@Sam O you are correct sir 
2020-09-17 11:47:00,Sam O,@T.Durden what's the cost of a tippmann stormer? That's the cheapest I can find for mag/hopper feed. It would be more realistic 
2020-09-17 12:13:00,Punisher95,Tippmann tmc 
2020-09-17 12:13:00,Punisher95,It's 250. But it's both mag fed and hopper fed 
2020-09-17 12:13:00,T.Durden,I can check. But a nice tippmann is 80 bucks. It's a nice and powerful gun. The style we've had at events so far for slowing or stopping their nonlethal tactics. 
2020-09-17 12:13:00,Sam O,Stormer is 200. But 50 extra for a better gun isn't bad 
2020-09-17 12:13:00,T.Durden,I'll call and get the cost for the tippmann tmc 
2020-09-17 12:13:00,Avatar,"Sam O I have a 98 custom with a stock and pic rail with cheap R/G dot Thanks! That would be awesome. Paintballs are cheap, and we can train against each other "

2020-09-17 17:41:00,Alena,I may be down that way Sunday to drop off donations for a family who lost everything in the fire. It depends on if they have a place at that time to accept them because of how much I collected would be a bit overwhelming (which is a good thing!) if they were still couch surfing. Would love to come if that‚Äôs ok just to meet folks face to face. Does anyone know of donation drop-off points in Northern Oregon? Not all of what I collected will be need by just this family.

2020-09-17 20:40:00,Alena,We are getting thunder up here too.  The fact that Zuckerburg is openly stating that they will censor anyone who is organizing against the left is not a surprise but I think we all see the writing on the wall. :/

2020-09-17 20:58:00,Erik,Facebook has already shut down quite a few patriot groups. Three percenters groups nationwide were shutdown they moved over to mewe. I heard of parlor app but I am not overly fond of providing my I.D. to join. 
2020-09-17 20:58:00,Shelley - Vancouver,I didn't have to give ID to join Parler that I recall. Love Parler! 
2020-09-17 20:58:00,Tony,MeWe Network? 
2020-09-17 20:58:00,Dee,Parler didn't ask for ID when I signed up a few months ago. I think maybe it's the *er and not the *or site you are looking for. 
2020-09-17 20:58:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"Officer involved shooting in Gresham under investigation. Happened about a half hour ago. Doesn't sound like any ""victim"" though. Not much info. Yes Parler "

2020-09-17 21:34:00,Sawyer,"It works for a secure chat anyway. Not for group video tho... I don't think. Never tried, but it's supposed to make secure phone calls too. It's like telegram, but does groups really well. End to end encrypted. "
2020-09-17 21:34:00,T.Durden,Is it like a chat server then?? Or something like twitter?? 
2020-09-17 21:34:00,Todd,Is there any secure way to video conference with those that can‚Äôt make the meeting? 
2020-09-17 21:34:00,Sawyer,"Signal is just like this... But it's secure. If it's good enough for Edward Snowden, it's good enough for me...lol "

2020-09-17 21:34:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"I have some news that may upset some of our members. Please read this entire text and please carefully contemplate your response. First, fellow Patriots, all of you are what makes this group amazing and possible! Working together with trust and integrity is crucial to our mission, our success, safety and survival. Irrefutable information and several recent events necessitated an immediate review and a vote by several leads and longtime members, to remove Robin from this group permanently. We all realize and appreciate Robin's efforts to start this group and help us grow and yes, this sucks. This was not an easy decision! Please trust that it was a necessary one, made to protect the best interest of our members and our group as a whole. We have a mission that we are all still committed to! We need each one of you to act with integrity and respect. We are not going to air all the details, or create drama and we are asking that you will also refrain from that conduct, as well. This will be difficult for Robin, and our members, keep in mind that it is required that once a member is removed, they cannot be privy to member info, intel, plans, etc. and obviously, violating those rules or a lack of integrity and respect would be grounds for removal. Drama will not be tolerated.  To be clear, no one in this group has been compromised and our priority is to keep it that way!  With that said, we are moving forward, hopefully all, together.  You will be invited to a new FB group within the next few days. Each member will be vetted. Be patient. Any delays with FB will not affect our mission.  Patriots, keep your chin up and remember the reasons you are here!  We will still be meeting up. It looks like Sunday at 3pm. Location should be finalized by tomorrow night.  We have a lot to discuss and yes, leads will be established,  etc.  In the meantime, we have a team that will be working hard vetting all intel and preparing info for release at that meeting. Everything we know will be shared then, so we can each make our own informed decisions.  We are excited to move forward, together!  We will have a name change. A mission statement and rules of conduct will be available soon for review.  We have some amazing sponsors and donors who wish to support us once we are re-established.  We will also fundraise for additional legal, issue gear, group needs, member needs, etc.  There will be training events coming soon.  Can't wait to share some exciting things we've been working on!  Thank you all for reading this far. So grateful for each one of you and proud to be a part of this group!     "

2020-09-17 22:46:00,Sam O,"Damn. Lol. I still prefer this group over our last. I'm glad our small group can be a part of a bigger whole, and we're excited to meet with you guys. It has definitely been a stressful week, and I hope the best for Red with whatever happened, and wherever she goes from here. I have avoided joining a militia for over 10 years, due to the shear unknown of it all, and back then they weren't all over Facebook, and I remember there was only around 2-3 big ones and they were in the distant corners of the state. I can definitely say that I feel a lot better knowing that I am not alone in my endeavor to secure myself and my family. Thanks. "

2020-09-19 09:34:00,Jay Thomas,Whats signal? 
2020-09-19 09:34:00,Erik,I download signal and sent a pm. I have used signal before. For those unaware of this app it has a feature that erases messages at a maximum of an hour time limit. If that feature cannot be disabled I believe can potentially hurt our communication with each other. If you dont constantly chech you're phone then that is lost information to you and people will have to constantly repeat messages. That feature is good for small groups but having over a hundred members I am not so sure. Just my opinion.  
2020-09-19 09:34:00,Trent -Medford,U can turn of the time limit 
2020-09-19 09:34:00,Sunshine,I added signal but im wondering why do we need to change? Is group me not a good app?

2020-09-19 09:59:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"There is an option to not have a chat erase. There is a risk to keeping communications. I would like to see people think before they text, but sometimes that doesn't happen. For example, Writing a text about beating an ant, even in jest, then there's an encounter, that even though defensive, that text will be used to paint a different picture by a DA. It's risky at best. That app also can be set to not allow screenshots, which further protects. Look up the articles on Patriot Front. 6 months of screenshots of actual hateful messages were shared with world... "
2020-09-19 09:59:00,Erik,@Shelley - Vancouver I agree everyone should be clearing messages on a regular basis. Especially before we go to rallies.

2020-09-19 11:40:00,Whitebear,How do I delete or hide individual messages in GroupMe? support.microsoft.com It works....but no deleting. 
2020-09-19 11:40:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"Everyone please install the telegram app. Then go to your settings and remove your full name, set a username if you didn't do that originally. Go to settings(upper left 3 bars) privacy and set options to your desired level. Set a time limit for your messages to be deleted. Bare in mind, that will occur from the time you post, regardless who has seen it or not. Choices are nobody or contacts for each thing in list. There's a setting to not allow your texts to be forwarded, I highly suggest that is utilized. Please bear in mind, with any chat app the media shared such as photos, can be saved to the individual phone. A time limit will be set to delete past texts for the entire group chat as well. The invite to groups will be sent shortly. "

2020-09-19 12:33:00,Sam O,Do we need telegram? Or signal? I'm lost. Have both 
2020-09-19 12:33:00,Shelley - Vancouver,Delete your signal app. We are testing the Telegram app. Spartan5 will create the group chats later today. 
2020-09-19 12:33:00,Sam O,"I have had one already, is it a requirement to delete it? I doesn't have anything from you guys. "
2020-09-19 12:33:00,Shelley - Vancouver,@Sam O I suggest you remove yourself to delete the daily chat on Signal if you were in it. 
2020-09-19 12:33:00,Sam O,I was not added to it. 
2020-09-19 12:33:00,D,So...what exactly is wrong with this site? 
2020-09-19 12:33:00,Whitebear,Not gonna even download app until testing is complete. Gonna discuss this site with an intel friend also. My biggest fear is that it may not be secure enough and subject to security risks if a user doesn't set it up correctly. 
2020-09-19 12:33:00,Shelley - Vancouver,This app does not allow a set timer to remove all messages. We're testing telegram 
2020-09-19 12:33:00,Sam O,"Dan mentioned that you can see chats if you know the name on telegram, but maybe that's just because they're set to public. "
2020-09-19 12:41:00,D,I see. 
2020-09-19 12:41:00,Shelley - Vancouver,@Sam O that is correct

2020-09-19 12:41:00,Todd,Working night shift and just woke up but it looks like we got rid of another drama queen and switching to telegram . That about right ? 
2020-09-19 12:41:00,Shelley - Vancouver,@Todd sounds accurate 
2020-09-19 12:41:00,13F1P,"I set up Telegram, not sure what to do with user name? "
2020-09-19 12:41:00,Whitebear,Is it asking you for a credit card number?! 
2020-09-19 13:04:00,Shelley - Vancouver,"Just select a user name that is what is shown to others. If you scroll up, I shared a screenshot of my privacy settings. There are also group settings when a group is initiated. You can set your own timer to have messages disappear It will not ask you for ccard "
2020-09-19 13:04:00,13F1P,"@Shelley - Vancouver , thanks! If its not painfully obvious to everyone by now, im not tech savvy. That's why I have zero social media. So bare with me and ill do my best. "
2020-09-19 13:15:00,Shelley - Vancouver,No worries at all. We all have our skill set. And that's what makes this group so valuable! I'll help with any thing you need tech wise!

1900-01-01 16:52:00,Bravo91,"@Raider12 mentioned this at our meeting yesterday, so I thought I'd share it again for those that missed it and might be interested in reading https://spencersunshine.com/2020/08/27/fortyways/amp/?__twitter_impression=true "
1900-01-01 16:52:00,Whitebear,Geez! 
1900-01-01 19:32:00,Sam O,Definitely 
1900-01-01 20:08:00,Iron Wolf 9,"In the interest of the long view, though we wont get into it here, with the rising temperature of the political climate we really should be sure we are watching the current news cyes closely, as coincidentally our street level opposition never seems to fail to act upon the going narrative.  Also , we need not forget our events at hand, but we must be sure we are looking toward November and the week of the elections.  I suspect an unprecedented leftist mobilisation , and that is simply based on the most recent news cycles, and it only goes up from here.  Something to archive for future consideration "
1900-01-01 20:08:00,T.Durden,I feel like the news is where they get their marching orders.

1900-01-01 20:20:00,Davidson,Copy I've been kinda out of the loop Fighting the riverside fire. Any updates? 
1900-01-01 22:04:00,Bravo91,"New leadership. We've switched to regional leads, working on doing community outreach projects, and restructuring. "
1900-01-01 05:59:00,Sam O,"For any upcoming political heat, I recommend finding your nearest patriot, and making a plan with them. My family and friends will head to my house, because it's far enough out of town, it's a hill, and it's defensible against city idiots. "
