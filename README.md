# Patriot Coalition Leaked Message Analysis
Various tools oriented towards the analysis of the [Patriot-Coalition-PNW-Daily-Chatter-Scrapes.txt](https://eugeneantifa.noblogs.org/files/2020/09/Patriot-Coalition-PNW-Daily-Chatter-Scrapes.txt) file as downloaded from the [Patriot Coalition: Leaked Messages Show Far-Right Group's Plans for Portland Violence](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/09/23/patriot-coalition-far-right-chat-logs-violence/) article on the [bell&iquest;ngcat](https://www.bellingcat.com) web site.

Possible tools derivable from parsed data such as the above comprise [network diagrams](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/network.html) and lookup applications of the various metadata extractable from the text file, e.g.:
- Network diagrams of message authors and respondents
- Web-based applications capable of querying for message text, authors, respondants, sentiment

Various intermediate text files and work products could be implemented as such might be helpful to another analyst's efforts.

At this point in time, to run the leaked_messages_extractor's logic, invoke the "extract_leaked_messages_to_csv_and_sqlite.py" within this folder.
